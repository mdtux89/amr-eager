On 2008-05-15 2008-05-15 2008-05-15 the Government of Russia proposed cooperation with India and China to increase security around Afghanistan in order to block drug supplies .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a joint news conference in Yekaterinburg with the foreign ministers of India and China stated that tightening security at Afghan borders would decrease the threat of drugs and terrorism .

Vladimir Putin was Dmitry Medvedev 's predecessor and mentor .
Most observers expect Dmitry Medvedev to continue the policies of Vladimir Putin , such as an assertive posture on the international scene and vow to strengthen the military .
Vladimir Putin fiercely opposed the United States ' plans to deploy missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic , and NATO 's plans to accept into the alliance Russia 's ex - Soviet neighbors , Ukraine and Georgia .
Vladimir Putin has threatened to point nuclear missiles at countries that take part in U.S. missile defense and opted out of a key Soviet - era arms control treaty .
Topol - M missiles are capable of hitting targets more than 10000 kilometers or 6000 miles away .
The missiles are deployed in both silo - based and truck - mounted versions .
Strategic missiles forces chief General Nikolai Solovtsov stated that the Topol - M is a new step in missile design .
Yuri solomonov designed the missile and stated that the missile drops engines at a significantly lower altitude than earlier designs which makes it hard for an enemy 's early warning system to detect the launch .
Yuri solomonov stated that the missiles ' warhead and decoys closely resemble one another in flight , making it very difficult for a foe to select the real target from a multitude of false ones .
Large oil revenues in recent years have allowed the Government of the Russia Federation to buy weapons and fund the development of new missiles .
Soviet - built nuclear submarines frequently need repairs and rarely leave the bases .
The Yuri dolgoruky is the first in a series of new nuclear submarines to be commissioned this year but the bulava nuclear - armed missile developed to equip the submarine has failed tests and the deployment prospects are uncertain .
Expert states that Iranian missile launch photo was doctored to show failed 4th missile launching .
20080710 director of the London - based International Institute for Strategic Studies 's non - proliferation program and former US State Department official Mark Fitzpatrick stated that an Iranian photograph showing a cluster of missile launches from a desert range was altered to add a 4th missile .
20080710 the image was replaced with an image of the same 3 missiles in the previous photo but in place of the 4th missile is a grounded missile and what appears to be a vehicle nearby .
20080710 the image with 4 launches was absent from Sepah 's main page but both images were in the archive .
Fitzpatrick stated that the photo was probably manipulated to obscure the failure of the 4th missile in order to maintain the impact of Iran 's demonstration of power .
The image was described as depicting part of military maneuvers in which nine missiles were test fired , including an enhanced version of the Shahab - 3 .
Iranian officials stated that the enhanced Shahab - 3 missile has a range of 1250 miles and thus could reach Israel and the majority of the Middle East .

A U.N. representative stated that the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan but that the chemicals needed to complete the conversion are being smuggled into Afghanistan from other countries .
The U.N. stated on 2008-07-28 2008-07-28 2008-07-28 that the international community should do more to stop chemicals used to convert opium to heroin from reaching Afghanistan and detailed increasing sophistication in Afghanistan 's drug trade .
Officials in the American - backed government and Taliban militants are believed to profit from the illicit trade .
U.N. figures show Afghanistan yielded approximately 9000 tons of opium in 2007 which could create more than 900 tons of heroin .
Afghanistan 's representative for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime Christina Oguz stated the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan mostly at laboratories in the border regions in the insurgency - plagued South and the East .
Oguz stated to reporters in Kabul that evidence of higher quality Afghan heroin indicates that the people running the labs are getting assistance from chemists who have come from outside the country as foreign consultants .
Oguz stated the chemists originated from countries near the border but did not detail specific countries .
Oguz stated the so - called precursor chemicals such as acetic anhydride also have legal uses including in the paint and pharmaceutical industries .
Oguz stated the chemicals often are legally exported but later diverted to Afghanistan for illicit goals and Afghanistan has no major legal industries that would require such chemicals .
Afghanistan does produce the opium which is the raw material for heroin but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals that are not produced inside Afghanistan and are smuggled into Afghanistan .
More than 200 tons of the chemicals have been seized by Afghan authorities since 2006 but some 13000 tons were needed based on 2007 's opium production figures .
Most seizures of the chemicals occur along the eastern border with Pakistan but a good deal comes via the western border with Iran .
Oguz stated the international community should share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals who were long - established and based in Afghanistan 's neighboring countries .
Western officials are increasingly concerned that Taliban militants are bankrolling the insurgency through the drug trade .
A former senior U.S. State Department counter - narcotics official wrote in an article in the 2008-07-27 2008-07-27 2008-07-27 issue of New York Times magazine that narco - corruption went to the top of the Afghan Government .
The official alleged Karzai was reluctant to move against big drug lords in Karzai 's political power base in the south of Afghanistan where most opium is produced .
Karzai has stated commitment to eliminating corruption and battling the drug trade .
Oguz stated on 2008-07-28 2008-07-28 2008-07-28 that corruption exists within the system but Afghanistan lacked a well - trained police force for many years and officials are only now taking steps in fighting corruption .

Estonia is hosting some Georgian websites to protect the websites from hackers .
Officials stated on 2008-08-26 2008-08-26 2008-08-26 2008-08-26 that Estonia is temporarily hosting the websites of Georgia 's Central Bank and Foreign Ministry as well as a Georgian English - languages news portal in order to protect the websites from cyber attacks .
The state - run Estonian informatics Center stated that Georgia has transferred key websites to services in other countries including Poland and France after some came under attack following the outbreak of war with Russia .
Estonian informatics center spokeswoman Katrin pargmae stated that hosting websites in different countries makes the websites more complicated and time - consuming for hackers to disrupt .
Estonia has previous experience coping with cyber attacks because Estonian government and private sector websites were targeted in 2007-05 2007-05 .
The 2007-05 2007-05 attacks were days after Estonia decided to relocate a Soviet war memorial and grave .
The relocation angered Estonia 's ethnic Russian minority and neighboring Russia .
Estonian officials did not accuse any country of mounting what the Estonian Government stated were highly organized and professional attacks .
The European Union 's highest court on 2008-09-03 2008-09-03 2008-09-03 2008-09-03 overturned a 2001 decision by European Union governments to freeze the assets of a Saudi businessman and a Sweden - based charity suspected of funding Al-Qaida terror groups .
The ruling conflicts with a United Nations anti - terror order obliging United Nations Member States to freeze assets of people and entities suspected of funding terror groups .
The European Union 's highest court also stated that the United Nations order failed to offer individuals on a terror blacklist or individuals on the defense any legal rights to a judicial review under European law .
The European Union 's highest court acknowledged that the reasons for freezing the assets of Yasin Al-Qadi and the Al-Barakaat International Foundation may be justified .
It is not known whether European Union nations which have set up a joint terror blacklist will unfreeze the assets .
None of the groups have so far been officially removed from the blacklist because European Union Governments argue the court rulings do not oblige the European Union nations to remove the names from the list but only force the European Union to inform the individuals and groups on the list that the assets have been frozen .
Head of the Saudi - based Muwafaq Foundation Yasin Al-Qadi appealed against the European Union 's decision to freeze proprietary assets .
United States Treasury officials allege the Muwafaq Foundation is an al-Qaida Front used to funnel millions of dollars and euros to al-Qaida .
Al-Barakaat International appealed the European Union 's decision to freeze 1 million Swedish kroner or 152247 United States dollars .
Lawyers for Al-Barakaat International stated that the money was being used to fund aid programs for families in Somalia .
Thomas Olsson stated that the lawyers for Al-Barakaat International would now examine ways of having the assets released to the Somali immigrants in Sweden who used the network to send funds to relatives in Somalia .
Thomas Olsson also stated that the lawyers for Al-Barakaat International have to examine the judicial consequences of the verdict as the sanctions remain on a United Nations level .
The European Union 's highest court stated on 2008-09-03 2008-09-03 2008-09-03 2008-09-03 that the 27 - nation European Union is required to inform any person whose assets are being frozen why as swiftly as possible after the decision is taken in order to allow the person with frozen assets the right to legal recourse .
This ruling may hinder international efforts to stop the financing of terror groups including al-Qaida .
The ruling stated that the lower European Union 's court judgment erred in law by stating that European Union courts had no jurisdiction to review the legality of the contested order to freeze assets of individuals and groups deemed to be funding terror groups by the United Nations .
Other suspects and groups on an European Union terror blacklist have also won legal victories for similar reasons against being listed .
These suspects and groups have so far not had assets unfrozen or names removed from the European Union 's blacklist .
The European Union 's High Court had previously overturned an European Union decision to freeze the assets of the People 's Mujahadeen of Iran .
The People 's Mujahadeen of Iran is an exiled Iranian Resistance movement that is on the European Union 's terror blacklist .
The European Union 's High Court recently overturned a decision to freeze the assets of an exiled Philippine rebel leader and the Netherlands - based Al-Aqsa Foundation because the leader and group were not informed why the assets were frozen which is a breach of EU law .
370 people have had assets frozen because of placement on a terrorist blacklist by the United Nations Security Council .

On 2008-09-09 2008-09-09 2008-09-09 2008-09-09 Swedish Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobsson dropped charges against the 3 Swedes arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism .
Swedish Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobsson stated on 2008-09-09 2008-09-09 2008-09-09 2008-09-09 that charges will not be pressed against the 3 Swedes arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism earlier in 2008 .
The charges are being dropped because Ronnie jaccobson can not provide that the men had intended to send money to terrorist organizations .
The Swedes were accused of using the informal money transfer networks called hawalas to send funds to alleged terror groups in Somalia .
Hawalas are a paperless system based on trust and oral agreements which is commonly used in the Middle East and parts of Asia and Africa .
Defense lawyer Thomas Olsson stated it was very tragic and a failure for Swedish law and order that the client Thomas Olsson was representing had been kept in detention for such a long time despite the weak evidence against client .
2 of the men were held for more than 3 months before being released at the start of the summer of 2008 .
Ronnie Jacobsson stated that a court had examined the detention order every 2 weeks and found there was reason to keep the men detained .
Both Norway and Sweden have been spared violent terror acts but authorities in both countries have voiced concern about terrorists or terror financiers operating out of Scandinavia .
In 2005 2 Iraqis were sentenced to prison in Sweden for collecting and transferring money to terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi .

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe addresses arms control issues and includes both Russia and Georgia as members .
The Dutch Foreign Ministry said Dutch government representatives will call for a political statement to be issued in which Member States pledge not to use cluster weapons in situations of this kind .
A single container typically scatters some 200 to 600 of the mini - explosives over an area the size of a football field .
Cluster bomblets have been criticized by human rights groups because they kill indiscriminately and because unexploded ordinance poses a threat to civilians similar to that of land mines .
More than 100 countries agreed in Dublin , Ireland , in 080500 to ban cluster bombs within 8 years .
Neither the Georgian nor Russian Governments signed the accord .

Great Britain is a 3 billion United States dollar per year arms exporter .
John Duncan stated that the treaty regulating the global arms trade has to be as universal as possible and that some the countries are arms manufacturers and that all nations are arms suppliers at one stage or another .
John Duncan stated that it is by closing loopholes that nations can stop arms distribution into the hands of criminals and terrorists .
The United States favors language contained in some of the negotiating documents about treaty regulating the global arms trade that require consensus decisions that essentially give the United States and other nations veto power .
That process included meetings from 071031 to 081031 among a group of experts that recommended items for consideration that included the consensus language .

Christina Rocca stated that the United States does not believe a global arms trade treaty would accomplish the promotion of responsibility in arms transfers and the reduction of the destabilizing trade in illicit arms .
Christina Rocca stated that the only way to convince all major arms exporting countries to sign on to the arms trade treaty would be to weaken the arms trade treaty provisions and a weak arms trade treaty would legitimize an international standard based on a lowest common denominator that would not address the problem of illicit and irresponsible arms transfers .

A report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece , Turkey and Belarus missed treaty deadlines to destroy their land mine stockpiles .
A 081121 report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece , Turkey and Belarus have missed deadlines that were required under an international treaty to destroy their land mine stockpiles .
Diplomats from Greece , Turkey and Belarus declined to be interviewed about the report in Geneva .
The report quoted the Governments of Greece , Turkey and Belarus as acknowledging that the deadlines have been missed .
Greece , Turkey and Belarus should have destroyed a total of nearly 7.5 million land mines by 080300 .
The 1155 - page annual report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece mentioned legal problems with contracting a company to carry out the destruction and the difficulty of finding environmentally safe destruction sites as reasons for the delay .
Turkey 's government claimed preparations for getting rid of Turkish stockpiles took longer than planned .
Belarus said there were delays in receiving support funds from the European Union .
Belarus said remaining stockpiles contains a type of mine that is more difficult and costly to destroy .

An institute for public policy research report said there are 27 weak states that pose a threat to Britain 's national security as the States could provide bases for terrorists .
The report was co - authored by former NATO chief George Robertson and published by international think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research .
The report said there are 27 weak states that pose a threat to Britain 's national security as the States could provide bases for terrorists .
The countries include Haiti , Nigeria , Somalia and Yemen and have vulnerable Governments that are unwilling or unable to control the territories .
The report 's authors stated criminal groups that fund terrorist organizations through drug trafficking and manufacturing counterfeit goods can operate in weak States without being detected .
Terrorists who raise funds in these States could then coordinate an attack on Britain .
The report stated transnational terrorists have discovered that the global space is largely unregulated with the rule of law either weak or nonexistent and is a place where terrorists can operate with a reasonable prospect of impunity as in the mountains of Afghanistan before 9/11 .
Deputy Director of the ippr and 1 of the report 's authors Ian kearns stated terrorists could run camps in remote areas which Governments rarely monitor .
Kearns referenced terrorist training camps in the Sahel which is a region of sub - Saharan Africa that runs though several countries including Mali , Chad and Sudan .

The report stated British government must help to stabilize weak states and push for international regulations that would stop terrorists using freely available information to create and unleash new forms of biological warfare such as a modified version of the influenza virus .
Kearns stated the Government must take a multilateral approach to areas including biotechnology but that the government is not moving quickly enough on the approach .
Kearns stated the global financial crisis shows the results of not having multilateral frameworks in place to deal with international issues .

Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned that European transfer of European technology to the People 's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan .
Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned on 040212 that the transfer of European technology to the People 's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan .
Lu noted that the European Union adopted a resolution to ban arms sales to mainland China after the Tiananmen massacre of 890000 and said it is worrisome that the leaders of France and Germany are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following years of commercial interest enticements by the PRC government .
Lu expressed concern that European advanced technology will be transferred to the mainland and added that such transfers would be helpful for the PRC government 's military buildup and will therefore encourage an invasion of Taiwan by the mainland .
Lu said that the government of mainland China has tried to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and has been increasing its military buildup against Taiwan .
Lu said the PRC government has deployed around 500 missiles targeting Taiwan and the number of missiles deployed is expected to increase to 650 next year .
Lu described the PRC government as a real international terrorist because of the threat of missiles aimed at Taiwan and the PRC 's preparations to invade Taiwan .
Lu added that this is why Taiwanese President Chen Shui - bian called for a peace referendum for 040320 alongside the Taiwanese presidential election .
Lu said European nations should not join the PRC government in opposing Taiwan 's planned referendum .
Lu said that Taiwan is not a part of the People 's Republic of China and has maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the world even though most of them do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan .
Taiwan has never ceased making efforts to participate in international activities and has made great contributions to global development despite being refused membership by many international organizations .
Lu 's remarks were made at Taiwan 's presidential office while receiving the mayor of the Austrian city of Innsbruck Hilde Zach .
Zach arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a 6 - day visit at the invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Zach hopes to gain a better understanding of Taiwan 's development in the political , economic , cultural and tourism fields .
Taiwan Executive Yuan may not approve Taiwanese participation in the construction of submarines sold from the United States .
A delegation of Taiwanese legislators completed an 11 - day fact - finding trip to the United States .
The Taiwan Executive Yuan submitted a NT $ 610.8 billion ( US $ 18.23 billion ) special budget to buy 388 Patriot PAC - III missiles , 8 conventional submarines and 12 P - 3 C anti - submarine aircraft from the United States earlier this month .
The budget is now pending approval by the Legislative Yuan .
Ker Chien - ming , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) whip at the Taiwan legislature said on 040628 that discussions are turning negative in regard to whether the China Shipbuilding Corp. ( CSBC ) should take part in the construction of submarines which the United States has promised to sell to Taiwan .
Navy Commander - in - Chief Miao Yung - Ching called on the Legislative Yuan to communicate on the review of the arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part .
Miao said it is not feasible for CSBC to take part in the construction of the submarines and that the Navy will negotiate with the United States on obtaining repair capacity and technology transfers .
Miao said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines .
The United States has control of the key technology in building the submarines .
Lee said on 040628 that the delegation asked the United States to shorten the delivery period of the submarines from 15 years to 10 years .
This indicates that Taiwan has already given up the policy of building the submarines itself .
Lee said that if the submarines are not built by Taiwan then the cost of the eight subs will be NT $ 100 billion less than the original plan of NT $ 400 billion .
Lee 's figures were based on the price tags of submarines sold from Germany and Spain along with the cost of obtaining repair capacity .
Lee was asked if the long delivery period of 10 years might affect Taiwan 's military strength and tip the military cross - Taiwan Strait balance toward mainland China after 050000 .
Lee answered that any possible naval military balance tilting toward the PRC after 050000 would not mean an eruption of war at that time .
Lee added that an order of Kidd - class destroyers due to arrive at Taiwan by the end of next year would allow Taiwan to still maintain its edge .
Lee also said that the United States will deliver the first 5 of 12 P - 3 C aircraft in 080000 , with another 3 in 090000 , 4 in 100000 and the final 4 in 110000 .
China 's military budget has grown in recent years leading some to believe that China is attempting to achieve global dominance .
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman and Taiwan 's top China policy planner Joseph Wu stated on 2007-03-04 2007-03-04 2007-03-04 2007-03-04 that China 's substantial military budget increase of 17.8 percent reveals an attempt at achieving global dominance .
Joseph Wu made his statement after China made public the Chinese draft budget bill for 2007 .
Joseph Wu stated that China is attempting to achieve global dominance because the significant budget increase , the lack of transparency in military buildup , the rapid expansion of air and naval forces , and progress in space defense technology suggests an attempt at global dominance .
Joseph Wu stated that China 's annual military spending has experienced double - digit growth since 1993 .
Joseph Wu also stated that growth in China 's military expenditure is not expected to slow down in the foreseeable future but will instead accelerate and become a long - term trend .
Joseph Wu stated that China 's continued military budget growth deserves global attention and concern because there is no apparent threat and no potential future threat to China 's security in sight .
Joseph Wu stated that China 's threat to Taiwan and other neighboring Asia - Pacific countries is rising .
Joseph Wu and Western military experts stated that China 's actual military budget is about 3 times the officially declared figure .
Joseph Wu stated that Taiwan 's plan to procure 3 expensive weaponry systems , 8 diesel - electric submarines , 6 Patriot PAC III anti - missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P - 3 C anti - submarine aircraft is aimed at strengthening the defense capability of Taiwan in light of China 's military buildup .
China 's Council of Agriculture opens a special office in charge of agricultural technology transfers and intellectual property rights management and consultancy to enhance development of China 's knowledge - based agriculture and applications of agricultural technology .
China 's Council of agriculture ( COA ) Deputy Minister Lee Jen - chyuan stated that the COA under the Executive Yuan opened a special office in charge of agricultural technology transfers and intellectual property rights ( IPR ) management and consultancy on 2008-01-28 2008-01-28 2008-01-28 .
Lee stated that the establishment of the Agricultural Technology Promotion Agency will help increase the total amount of technological transfer contracts through 2011 to 500 million new Taiwan dollars ( 15.46 million US dollars ) .
Lee stated that the COA has spent the past several years setting up relevant mechanisms and drafting a set of promotional measures to enhance development of China 's knowledge - based agriculture and applications of agricultural technology .
Lee stated that the COA will commission the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( Itri ) to carry out a special project on the management and application of agricultural R & D achievements in order to upgrade agricultural technology research and development , protection , management and applications .
An Itri official stated that the Agricultural Technology Promotion Office will cooperate with world - renowned IPR application institutions to push for revising the relevant regulations on IPR and technological transfers and to enhance IPR education and training .
The Itri official stated that the Office will serve as a platform to introduce various R & D achievements realized by experimental and research institutes under the COA to local businesses in an attempt to expand the application of agricultural technology .
The Ministry of Economic Affairs ( moea ) gave preliminary approval to 2 major China - bound investment projects at a review meeting on 2008-02-15 2008-02-15 2008-02-15 .
The Ministry of Economic Affairs ( moea ) gave preliminary approval to 2 major China - bound investment projects at a review meeting on 2008-02-15 2008-02-15 2008-02-15 .
The 2 projects include Formosa Plastics Group 's ( fpg 's ) plan to invest 100 million US dollars in a specialty steel company in Zhangzhou in Fujian province and semiconductor packager and Tester ASE 's plan to increase investment in ASE 's Shanghai packaging plant by 30 million US dollars .
Chen made the statement after presiding over an Interministerial Conference on whether the projects were in line with the Government 's active management and effective opening policy regarding investment in China .
Chen stated that the Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs is expected to formally approve the projects the week of 17 February 2008 since the projects have passed policy - related screening .
Fpg Chairman Li Chih - chun , Formosa Heavy Industry Corp. President Wu Kuo - hsiung and ASE Chairman Jason Chang attended the review meeting to explain investment plans and future business development blueprints in detail .
The company chairmen and President reported on financing plans , technology transfer and equipment delivery as well as globalization plans and matching investment in Taiwan .
Chen stated fpg pledged an investment in Taiwan that will reach 813.3 billion NT dollars ( 25.67 billion US dollars ) by 2013 and that related equipment will be produced in Taiwan and delivered to China .
Chen stated fpg technical and management staff will be recruited in Taiwan to create job opportunities .
Chen stated ASE has invested over 145 billion NT dollars in Taiwan and indicated increasing investment in Taiwan depending on market circumstances .
The ministry previously approved investment projects by semiconductor manufacturers to relocate 8 - inch - wafer plants using a 0.25 - micron manufacturing process to China .
The the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( moea ) approved lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries for Chinese investment .
On 2008-04-08 2008-04-08 2008-04-08 the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( moea ) announced approval for 4 Chinese investment proposals from Chinese manufacturers .
Lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries were approved for investment and will invest in integrated circuit packaging ( ICP ) and testing .
The moea determined in a meeting on 2008-04-08 2008-04-08 2008-04-08 that the investment proposals met the clauses in the China Investment procedure issued by the ministry 's Investment Commission .
The Investment Commission 's Executive Secretary Fan Liang - Tung stated the investment procedure aims to ensure Taiwan 's investments in China will not harm Taiwan 's industries and economy such as by leaking key technologies to the mainland .
Under the procedure investment plans require approval from the moea if the plans involve a single investment that exceeds 100 million US dollars , the company 's total investment in China reaches 200 million US dollars , or the investment could transfer core local industries ' technologies to China .
Fan stated core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 8 - inch wafers and 4 - inch TFT panels as well as IC packaging .
After the meeting on 2008-04-08 2008-04-08 2008-04-08 the Commission requires written documents to further assess the plans which contain each company 's commitment on the terms of investment including the financial plan , information on any technology transfers and the company 's domestic investment as well as employment information .
Fan stated lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries have made commitments to return capital to Taiwan in the amounts of 2 billion NT dollars , 19.2 billion NT dollars , 3 billion NT dollars and 23 billion NT dollars respectively by 2011 .
Fan stated the Commission will ensure the commitments are upheld once the investments are under way .
Fan stated the procedure would push Chinese investment from Taiwan to focus on down scale manufacturers rather than technology - concentrated makers in a bid to keep high - end technologies in Taiwan .
Fan stated the Commission will hold a 2nd round of meetings to decide if the proposals will take effect and that the final decision will be made by 2008-04-30 2008-04-30 2008-04-30 .
The process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled Balkans was formally launched in Bonn , Germany , when foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met to discuss what form further talks should take .
The long process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled Balkans was formally launched on 951218 in Bonn , Germany .
Foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met in Bonn to discuss what form further talks should take .
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in opening remarks at the one - day meeting that there can be no peace in the former Yugoslavia if some parties to the conflict remain heavily armed and others try to catch up .
The Croation delegation threatened to pull out of arms - reduction negotiations if certain demands were not met in the nearest future .
Delegates from other countries called on Croatia , Bosnia - Herzegovina and Serbia to set aside their grievances and learn to compromise .
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic complained that a part of Croatian territory is under occupation and time is running out .
Granic said in reference to disputed lands on the Croatian - Serbian border that the peaceful re - integration of Eastern Slavonia is the key to the lasting stability in the region and that everyone faces the danger of another round of hostilities and the destabilization of the whole region and highly unpredictable consequences for Bosnia - Herzegovina without it .
Conference participants said Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic from Serbia scolded his Croatian counterpart for grandstanding .
Then Milutinovic made a threat to pull out of arms - control negotiations .
Milutinovic noted the Serbian Government has been suspended since 920000 from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and said that unless full membership were restored Yugoslavia will be prevented from cooperating despite its readiness to do so .
Michael Williams is a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and formerly the United Nations ' senior spokesman for Croatia and called the early threats from Croatia and Serbia a worrying development and an ominous development .
Williams said it was really not clear that the parties are willing to engage in any arms control in a meaningful way .
This corresponds to a fear expressed by some delegates to the 951218 Bonn meeting that the yugolav parties do not want to negotiate away the ability to use violence or a threat of violence to seize territory .
Greek Foreign Minister karelos Papoulias observed of the Balkan belligerents that during talk in the plenary session one realizes that this is still the way they are thinking .
Papoulias said the Greek government is not as optimistic as other European partners and that just because there is a Conference does n't mean there is friendship between the people of the former Yugoslavia .
The 951218 talks were organized to fulfill the combatants ' pledge made in Dayton , Ohio , to begin talks to enhance mutual confidence and reduce the risk of conflict within 7 days of the Peace Accord 's formal signing .
The agenda on 951218 was limited to set the formal process for coming weeks .
The German Foreign Ministry said in a statement that this was so as to clear the way for speedy negotiation of the substantive questions .
Croatia , Bosnia - Herzegovina and Serbia are the nations that signed the Dayton accord and are supposed to report how many tanks and armored vehicles , heavy artillery pieces , combat aircraft and attack helicopters they possess in the next phase .
This data will be used to establish baselines from which weapons ceilings can be agreed on .
Croatia , Bosnia - Herzegovina and Serbia have promised to accept a set of automatic limits if agreement on such ceilings can not be reached in 180 days .
Kinkel said that on 951218 delegates had been unable to fix a date for the next round of talks but said the next talks would be 960104 or 960107 in Vienna .
Kinkel said minor problems not substantive discord kept delegates from choosing a firm date .
U.S. intelligence officials stated Libyan government was the intended recipient of the cargo .
Records show that on 1999-04-20 1999-04-20 1999-04-20 the kuwolsan made detours to 2 Thai ports to pick up 14000 tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan 's destination .
The kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an Indian company after a deal to sell the sugar to Algerians failed .
An Indian investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying 200 tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy .
The kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for Pakistan .
Indian officials learned that the company in Malta listed as the intended recipient of the cargo was fictitious .
Indian officials questioned why anyone in Malta would choose to buy water refining equipment from North Korea when Malta is a short flight from Europe .
Tae blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if Indian officials did not allow Tae to leave Kandla .
On 1999-06-30 1999-06-30 1999-06-30 customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan 's cargo boxes and Tae stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from North Korean officials .
Tae received instructions from officials in Pyongyang to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs .
The report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers .
According to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter , tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews ' bodies .
An Indian official who was present on the kuwolsan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity stated the situation became physical and there were fisticuffs .
The official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside .
On 1999-07-01 1999-07-01 1999-07-01 armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan .
A few crates among the kuwolsan 's cargo contained equipment that could be used in a water treatment plant .
Documents from the investigation contain a partial list of the contents of most of the cargo crates which included --
Rocket nose cones , stacks of metal pipe and heavy - duty presses used for milling high - grade steel .
A Plate - bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets , toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile , and Theodolites that measure missile trajectories .
Personal items presumably intended for North Korean workers , including cookbooks in Korean , Korean spices , pickles and acupuncture sets .
An Indian government official familiar with the kuwolsan discovery stated that in the past officials had seen missiles or engine parts , but here was an entire assembly line for missiles offered for sale .
A technical committee of Indian missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile - making capability .
The technical panel wrote in a report that the cargo points to only one end - use , namely the assembling of missiles and manufacture of the parts and subassemblies of surface to surface missiles .
Some of the packets were labeled in English as Scud B or Scud C. Nearly all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in Korean .
The Scud B and Scud C designs found on the kuwolsan were from older North Korean missile programs which were derived from Soviet missile designs of the 1950s .
One Indian government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional .
Retired director of the State Department 's Office on strategic , proliferation and military issues in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research Greg Thielmann stated the CIA utilized the blueprints to make full mock - ups of missiles complete with decals .
The blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of North Korea 's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the United States and North Korea since the 1980s .
The cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments .
Missile expert and senior analyst at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies Timothy V. McCarthy examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from North Korea to Libya .
McCarthy stated the information gives U.S. officials an idea of how capable North Korean scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives U.S. officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country 's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country 's officials .
McCarthy stated no one can stop Libyan scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles .
The kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after Indian officials released the kuwolsan in 2000 .
Shipping experts at Lloyd 's maritime division in London stated the kuwolsan 's name was changed in the summer of 2000 to Sun grisan 9 .
As of the week of 3 August 2003 the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the Somalian capital of Mogadishu .
As stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the United States and India the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of North Korea as the world 's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation .
In 1999 North Korean leader Kim Jong Il expelled U.N. inspectors , abandoned the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty and declared plans to build an atomic weapon .
U.S. intelligence officials stated that North Korean officials are continuing global trade in technology for weapons of mass destruction including instructions for making advanced missiles .
Successive U.S. administrations have condemned North Korea 's missile sales to such countries as Iran and Syria .
On 1998-08-31 1998-08-31 1998-08-31 North Korean officials launched a 3 - stage missile which heightened fears of advanced North Korean designs capable of reaching the U.S. mainland .
The first stage splashed down in the Sea of Japan , the second stage crossed the main island of Japan and the third broke up and traveled 3450 miles downrange and fell into the Pacific Ocean .
The missile test fueled work on a U.S. missile defense shield .
North Korean officials have defended the right to sell weapons and have stated that North Korean officials are not bound by international treaties restricting such trade .
North Korean officials have sold missiles and parts to Yemen which received 15 Scud missiles after the missiles were briefly intercepted by U.S. and Spanish naval crews off the Yemeni coast in 1998-12 1998-12 .
Libya appears to be the latest beneficiary of North Korean weapons .
Other nations including Iran , Pakistan and Syria are known to have received similar help .
The kuwolsan cargo attests to the existence of a gray zone composed of a combination of weak States , open borders , lack of controls and a market of buyers and sellers of weapons of mass destruction .
Korea specialist with the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California Daniel pinkston stated that intercepting weapons and equipment is difficult but not impossible but that human exchanges of plans , data , and intellectual property are difficult to intercept .
China confirmed on 2007-01-23 2007-01-23 2007-01-23 2007-01-23 after 12 days of silence that China had fired a guided missile into space to destroy one of its satellites .
China confirmed on 2007-01-23 2007-01-23 2007-01-23 2007-01-23 after 12 days of silence that China had fired a guided missile into space to destroy one of its satellites .
Liu Jianchao stated that the use of anti - satellite technology does not mean China has abandoned its long - standing opposition to the military use of space .
Liu Jianchao said at a ministry briefing that the test was not targeted against any country and does not pose a threat to any country .
The Chinese test shot destroyed an overage weather satellite 537 miles above Earth and was detected by U.S. monitors 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 .
The Chinese government refused to discuss it .
Officials and analysts interpreted it as a signal that U.S. military satellites could be vulnerable to attack by China .
China 's ability to shoot down satellites could pose an added threat in the event of hostilities over Taiwan because the U.S. military relies on satellites for reconnaissance , navigation , weapons guidance systems and anti - missile defenses .
China 's newly demonstrated ability could threaten Taiwanese satellites monitoring Chinese short - and medium - range missile deployments along the Taiwan Strait .
U.S. officials were dismayed by the Chinese test because the United States and Russia have abstained from such tests after testing anti - satellite technology in the 1980s .
This decision was partly because destroying satellites creates debris that could damage satellites in nearby orbits .
Liu declined to address questions on this danger .
The satellite orbited in a section of space where 125 other satellites fly .
China has started an accelerated military modernization program and has repeatedly stated its desire to be able to compete in 21st - century warfare .
This includes the use of advanced electronics and information systems .
The Chinese military runs China 's space program and has identified space - based communications and sensing systems as key to such efforts .
Pinpoint weapons would be used to disrupt the more advanced and better - equipped U.S. military .
Analysts believed that the 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 test was part of the military modernization program despite China 's frequent declarations that it wants to prevent an arms race in space .
Liu repeated the long - standing Chinese position when asked about the appearance of a contradiction and said China will further promote de - weaponization and the peaceful use of outer space .
China has consistently advocated at the United Nations for the peaceful development of space and pushed for an international agreement to prevent it from becoming the theater for a new arms race .
The United States has opposed China 's suggestion for an international conference to pursue such an accord and argued there is no need for it .
Liu was asked whether the anti - satellite test violated the spirit of China 's proclaimed position and why China kept silent for nearly two weeks while officials around the world were discussing it on the basis of U.S. intelligence reports .
China made the response about the test quickly after the relevant parties expressed their concerns .
China stressed that opposition of weaponization and an arms race in outer space .
The interior ministry said Saudi police have arrested 10 men and accused them of collecting donations to fund terrorist acts outside the Kingdom .
A lawyer and a prominent dissident said that at least seven of the men were Saudi democracy activists whose arrest was a government attempt to abort their civic rights work .
The interior ministry said Saudi police have arrested 10 men and accused them of collecting donations to fund terrorist acts outside the Kingdom .
A lawyer and a prominent dissident said that at least seven of the men were Saudi democracy activists whose arrest was a government attempt to abort their civic rights work .
The men were mostly of them lawyers and professors .
Al-Faleh was jailed in 2004 for calling for more democracy in the kingdom .
The men had planned to present authorities with a list of more than 40 prisoners without legal representation whom they intended to defend .
Al-Faleh said the terrorist allegation is a cover - up and that it was used to get al-Faleh arrested .
Police went to the Jiddah beach house of lawyer Essam basrawi on Friday night and arrested basrawi and five other Saudi men .
Bassim Alim said Saudi businessman Abdul - Aziz Al-khereiji was arrested at a checkpoint as Al-khereiji drove with his wife to Jiddah .
Basrawi 's Moroccan personal assistant also was detained .
An interior ministry spokesman told local newspapers that the arrested men had been involved in financing recruiters who sign up young Saudis to go into turbulent areas .
Many young Saudi radicals have crossed the long and porous border between the Kingdom and Iraq and joined up with Sunni Muslim insurgents there .
Alim said that the government 's accusations were baseless and that his clients were well - known reformists with no connection to terrorism .
Alim said the men might have been raising funds for Palestinian or Iraqi refugees .
The men had been warned repeatedly by the government not to gather or write petitions because authorities feared the rise of a new political reform movement .
Alim said the men do not want any kind of organized reform movement .
The men are trying to stop any organized calls for reform .
Alim said police had illegally searched the men 's homes without warrants and seized files , books and computers .
Neither Alim nor family members have been allowed to see the arrested men .
Faleh did not know why they were not allowed lawyers or charged publicly or shown proof or evidence if they are guilty of the crime .
The arrests were the first to target democracy activists since reform - minded King Abdullah took the throne in 2005 and pardoned Faleh and two other leading activists who had spent 18 months in prison .
A dozen other men arrested with them in 2004-03 2004-03 signed statements pledging to stop lobbying for political freedoms .
Faleh and the two others refused to sign and demanded legal representation and a public trial .
Legal Defense and public trials are allowed under Saudi law but rarely applied .
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy and has a consultative council appointed by the government .
The Kingdom continues to show little tolerance for political opposition despite slow progression toward reform from Abdullah .
It imposes strict limits on freedom of expression and bans public gatherings and political parties .
Sulaiman Al-Rushoodi is a lawyer and former judge who had been among the group of activists detained in 2004 .
Al-Rushoodi was released several weeks later after pledging to address his demands solely to authorities .
Al-Rushoodi joined the defense team of three activists still behind bars .
The Consultative Shura Council recently announced it was considering laws permitting the setting up of civic rights groups which are currently not allowed in the Kingdom .
Saudi Arabia has two Government - appointed human rights committees but bans independent human and civil rights organizations .
China has built and launched a communications satellite for Nigeria .
Chinese officials stated on 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 that China had launched a Chinese manufactured communications satellite into orbit on behalf of Nigeria .
The Chinese officials also stated that the satellite will go into operation by 2007 2007 2007 2007 and is expected to last 15 years .
This launch marks the first time China has built a commercial satellite and put the satellite into orbit on contract for another country .
The launch occurred on 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 dawn near the Xichang space center in southwestern Sichuan province .
Some view the launch as another sign of China 's increasing skill in space technology and China 's determination to be among the world 's great powers seeking to utilize the reaches of outer space for benefits on earth .
China 's space program 's rapid progress has caused worries in the United States because the program is run by the military and China has been recently emphasizing space - based information warfare .
The concern intensified following the successful 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 2007-01-11 test - firing of an anti - satellite missile .
China 's space agency sent 2 astronauts into orbit in 2005-10 2005-10 in the Agency 's second manned spaceflight .
The Chinese government on 2007-05-07 2007-05-07 2007-05-07 2007-05-07 adopted a 10 year plan for expanded space exploration .
The plan includes more manned flights as well as unmanned probes of the Moon and beyond .
Chinese officials stated that the launch of the nigcomsat - 1 aboard a Long XXXX - 03-03 XXXX - 03-03 B rocket on 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 2007-05-14 represented a commercial challenge .
Some saw the launch as a symbol of China 's broad network of economic relations with Africa .
The official New China News Agency stated that the satellite represents China 's wish to cooperate with developing countries in the peaceful use of outer space and to promote a closer relationship between China and African countries .
Nigeria 's managing director of the nigcomsat - 1 project Hammed Rufai stated that the launch was a breakthrough in ending the exclusive reliance on oil because the satellite will help Nigeria move toward knowledge - based industries .
The official New China News Agency stated that China secured the 311 million dollar contract in 2004 in a bidding process in which 21 other companies took part .
President of the Great Wall Industry Corporation Wang Haibo stated that the Nigerian contract puts China onto the short list of countries that can build , launch and maintain a satellite for other nations .
Chinese officials stated that about 30 similar contracts have been signed for future launches .
In the 1990s China frequently launched satellites for other countries after the satellites were manufactured elsewhere and acquired a reputation for providing such services more cheaply than other launch - capable countries .
China had been trying to establish commercial relations with oil - producing nations such as Nigeria as the Chinese economy grows nearly 10 percent a year .
Some officials have stated that Nigeria hopes to sell communications bands to neighboring African countries .
There were multiple attacks including hand - grenade assaults and decapitations , with police , federal agents and rival drug - traffickers the principal victims .
2007-06-04 2007-06-04 2007-06-04 2007-06-04 6 hooded gunmen entered the traditional all - night wake and shot two people , killing both .
The gunmen had written Z 's on the victims ' backs before the left .
There were multiple attacks including hand - grenade assaults and decapitations , with police , federal agents and rival drug - traffickers the principal victims .
The killings show the scope of the violence and the tactics of psychological warfare behind it .
At least one of those bands appears to be splitting into different groups .
The new blood refers to a group of Gulf cartel operatives who have turned against the zetas as members of the organization bid to control trafficking routes and local drug markets .
Garcia Luna said in a recent press conference that the extreme violence in Mexico was part of a strategy by drug traffickers to force authorities into a strategic retreat .
Garcia Luna said that they are trying to create a climate of intimidation and fear in order to gain operational advantages .
Luna said the residents of a rural town or urban neighborhood will refuse to cooperate with authorities and create a social space of support for traffickers if they believe that drug traffickers can not be defeated .
Gruesome killings have become frequent during the war this year .
New incidents of violence have arisen every day this week .
The message said police were protecting rival drug traffickers and that the decapitated man had been selling drugs for a rival group .
The body later was stolen from its crypt .
Another victim of the violence in Veracruz can not yet be tallied among the dead .
Business owner Roberto moguel Martinez was kidnapped by armed men on 2007-06-06 2007-06-06 2007-06-06 2007-06-06 after being released from a hospital .
Martinez had been recovering from wounds suffered in a 2007-05-31 2007-05-31 2007-05-31 2007-05-31 attack .
Martinez 's mother wrestled briefly with Martinez 's armed kidnappers on a street in the center of the city according to the Veracruz newspaper notiver .
The dead included three people shot on a highway in the State of Durango in northwest Mexico .
This happened on a week when President Felipe Calderon traveled to Europe to meet with Pope Benedict XVI and other leaders .
Calderon said that this is a shared problem between the United States and Mexico .
And the U.S. is the prime consumer in the world .
Calderon has sent the army to numerous Mexican states to fill in for over - matched and corrupt local police .
19 members of the army were ordered on 2007-06-04 2007-06-04 2007-06-04 2007-06-04 to be imprisoned as suspects in the killing of three women and two children at a rural anti - smuggling checkpoint in Sinaloa .
Military officials said they had failed to stop at the checkpoint .
An estimated 1,200 people were already killed in the violence this year .
the ones who are suffering are the ordinary people : even if the body of a salted fish is turned over , it is still a salted fish ...
Freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
What is more they are considered traitors of China , which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism .
In fact , the US no longer needs to use force to deal with China , they have achieved the result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting " .
Is the article too intense , is the United States so good ?
If things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , three people create a tiger .
It should vigorously advocated
Some people - do n't forget you are Chinese ; if the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness !
I really especially hate those who are eating Chinese things and drinking Chinese things , but who say America is so whatever , those dogs , if America is so good go find your American illegitimate fathers
I feel our people should learn more from the DPRK , the banner of socialism needs to be held , but Mao Zedong Thought ca n't be forgotten !
Only Mao Zedong Thought , can save the nation !
There are so many traitors in the history of China - we need to be vigilant .
With the chaos in East and North Africa , we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from colluding with Western imperialism .
Everything has its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in China , traitors can only bark madly like dogs and nothing else , can only make them disappointed .
This just is a specialty of modern China there 's nothing we can do
Freedom of speech is relative . We need take national conditions into account .
Freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,

Look at the Kuomintang - Communist cooperation of those years and you will know ...
It can compete with articles from the Cultural Revolution , magnifying a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line , buttoning the hat .
If you want to destroy a people , first of all is his national culture , whose tool is language and writing . Currently the one which everyone who is going to the next grade or entering a higher school must all be tested on is English -
you are a dragon coiling , you are a tiger crouching , it makes sense , wait for the opportunity
In fact , US no longer needs to use force to deal with China , they have reached a result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting " ...
Yes . There are many slaves of foreigners . It 's time we should renovate !
The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of China ! Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself . Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China , let the Chinese themselves topple China - and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so - called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and can not let outsiders use us .
I have reasons to say this : these last several days I have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a glimpse I see they are disciples of Wang Jingwei !
Western society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy .
The domestic political development is truly too slow , being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable . Can we blame others for this ?
Some propaganda activities of ZF have soon become viewed as jokes by the people .
We ca n't look over the old accounts of the previous so - called anti - Japanese war .
Take a look at North Korea , that 's our country many years ago . Take a look at their ridiculous propaganda .
The United States ' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned .
These people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position , and are distributed in various circles in society , taking great pains to promote American values * and brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Because these days , I 've been reading part of the " Specialist Professor " blog , it would have been okay if I did n't read it , but after I read it , it made me really surprised .
For example , Assistant Professor Zhang Ming of Renmin University , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious .
Such as , in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in China to elementary school textbooks having " Wang Erxiao " , and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .
Another example is so - called " sexologist " and " social activist " Li Yinhe - one , her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise " Haite Sexology Report " ; two , she has no deep thought ; and three , she has no significant contributions .
She main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people 's eyes , but without real ability or learning , she 's purely a jumping clown ,
This kind of person puts on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet does n't understand politics , is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing , is ignorant yet feels fine .
Like in the essay " A bit less hostility , a bit more harmony " , she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti - pornography - and - illegal - publications drive as social hostility ;
in the essay " China has already become the country which worships money most on the earth " , she attributes Chinese society 's worship of money to atheism ;
the essay " Are you studying Paul or studying Bill ? " , she blathers that " people who study Paul will become terrorists " ;
in the essay " Recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products " , she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the Beijing anti - pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc.
Especially today 's masterpiece , " Why is it worth paying such close attention to the Jianghe obscene goods case ? " , where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by Beijing City , as well as detailing a list of erotic products , with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people . "
And there is also Sichuanese poet Liu Shahe , who , while America clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of China and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant , actually comes out with the fallacy " China and America are friendly " , and tries to pour spirit - confusing soup on the Chinese people willfully and without fear ;
Yi Zhongtian , who got famous by remarking upon the " three countries " , whose talent and learning I have always respected , but I did n't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of China , Mao Yushi , saying some things like " I believe whoever disrespects Mao Yushi is not human " , once again making me very much drop my glasses !
Also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " Complete notes on 100 Chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the Ford Foundation " , I feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in China who are " becoming treasonous " are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country .
But I do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remarks , why no one curbs them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?
Contacting " Southern newspapers " , which were temporarily fierce a short while ago , I feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities !
I remember , 60 - some years ago the US had just fought a war with China , and still threatened China with the use of nuclear weapons ;
40 - some years ago , the US entered Vietnam with the intention of containing China ;
although 32 years ago it had established relations with China , 22 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on China , 12 years ago it bombed a Chinese embassy , 10 years ago the South China Sea collision incident occurred , and two years ago it restarted its containment of China with great fanfare .
I do n't understand , why are we Chinese so forgetful ?
Why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the US ?
Without taking a big loss , people do n't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us Chinese .
Therefore , it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of China are rampaging and the fifth column is running rampant
It 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitors to China " among primary school students ?

Mr. Zhengqing , the things you say are quite astonishing , there possibly is a suspicion that there are fragments , even if they are a fifth column , they would n't be so bare - boned , we should allow the existence of different opinions , the times are really different , no matter if its democracy or pan - Occidentalism , neither are beneficial to China , do n't be afraid , what do you say

A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported .
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said .
Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York - based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
" We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , " said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute .
The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in " very modest amounts " in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
" The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , " said Dr. Talcott .
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said .
The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters .
The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said .
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained .
In XXXX - 07 , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
" There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , " said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
" But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
Yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since XXXX - 08 XXXX - 08 , according to Donoghue 's .
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days .
Nevertheless , said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields " may blip up again before they blip down " because of recent rises in short - term interest rates .
The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
Dreyfus World - Wide Dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a seven - day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier .
It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
The 30 - day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30 - day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .

The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the Senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .

The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting .
And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .
On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory .
For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist - comedian Victor Borge .
The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .
Back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again .
Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .

Exports in XXXX - 10 stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from XXXX - 10 XXXX - 10 .
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .

Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years .
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report .
Alan Spoon , recently named Newsweek president , said Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in XXXX - 01 .
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , partisans of Ronald Reagan claimed he had " won " the cold war .
Although a careful review of the facts will show it was not true , the claim was that the Soviet Union became overextended attempting to keep up with Ray - gun 's defense spending .
Pappy Bush , who was the president at the time , claimed that he had won the cold war since the collapse of the Soviet Union happened on his watch .
Globalism was hailed by its partisans as the natural consequence of their " victory , " and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessings of a problematic freedom to the people of the world .
Always impatient of any restaint , capitalists used this so - called victory as justification for the opposition to , or calls for the roll - back of any regulatory restraint .
Now , with the various " Occupy " movements , it is ( or ought to be ) obvious that a great many people are less than enchanted with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracies , as well as in the countries into which capitalists from the industrial democracies go to invest .
What are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities ?
Health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not EVER do whats right for humanity .
@Setanta , I do n't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism .
Capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules , plays by the rules and enforces the rules .
If everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules , understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules , that is where trouble really begins .
Removing rules does n't help business be more competitive , it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there .
Out of all of the examples I saw , the only one I would agree with is the bomb toting Arab .
That is extremely rude , though I can see the humor in it .
In a college , that kind of costume should not have a place .
But these kids are listing Geisha costumes , sombreros + donkeys , and a few other costumes that they deem ' racially insensitive '
It is not showing someone doing something derogatory , it is using the clothes of a society for a costume .
Sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended .
There will ALWAYS be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it .
Dressing in a costume or NOT dressing in one will not change that .
And why is it that only those races / cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive ?
Is it not JUST as rude to wear torn over alls , stained shirt , black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly ?
And if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads , they will always find justification no matter what .
But why are we as a so called free society really jumping on board this super PC behavior ?
Why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination ?
These students are bleeding idealism and have n't been tempered enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural obsessions and that these costumes are n't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be .
I mean if racist costumes were actually being banned , you all might have a point .
They say " ... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome " .
They are n't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything .
They are making posters expressing their opinion .
Of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech .
Neither should be banned .
Whether your costume involves black face and a noose , or whether it is a grilled sandwich where I think the cheese is a little too drippy is irrelevant .
Free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the " banning " that is being alleged .
SO dear Massachusetters , does she have any chance in dethroning the sitting Republican Senator , Scott Brown ?

In Massachusetts , it would seem a lot easier task then in other Senate races .
He may vote along party lines for most things but he 's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal - leaning constituency .
Care to explain why you think he is an idiot ?
Coakley was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - I 'll hunt around for a great article I read a year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made .
As for Brown , he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion .
I have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all , and several which are really just embarrassing .
I have n't really been active in ( or even really cared about ) politics until recently and I 'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this .
Well , just telling you who I 'll vote for probably wo n't inform you much though right ?
Obama because I think he has done a good job in most areas ; some areas he let me down , plus there is no way I would vote for a republican today .
I think the majority of them are the reason this country has become constipated concerning everything that is important .
They are willing to throw America under the bus in order to make Obama look bad .
I 'm voting for Obama because I think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances , and can do much more with another term , and because I really worry about what any of the possible Republican nominees would do as president if one of them won .
I also would n't vote for just about any republican ( especially Rick Perry ) but I have heard some good things about Ron Paul , he 's about the only republican that I 'm actually interested in learning more about .
My own opinion of Ron Paul is that I 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debates .
I like how he 's anti - war and anti - bullshit in general .
Andrew Sullivan has a lot of posts on him , that might be a good place to start if you 're interested in learning more .
I read a fascinating piece in the WSJ today .
He apparently appears to be unable to pull Congress together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he got elected to a second term .
He would like Obama to bow out for a 2nd term , and have Hillary Clinton run for president .
He believes that Hillary has the best chance of bringing the country together .
I do n't know how she feels about running , but , IMO , I think that it is a great idea .
She certainly has the smarts , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizens .
I think that the people on the Republican side of the fence , are a poor bunch .
There is not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the American people .
The voters who will decide this election , IMO are the moderates and the independents . THEY certainly will not vote for any of the anti - gay , pro - life bible bangers .
Hillary 's time has come , and gone ...
She would make her self no friend of the Democratic party by dividing them and losing the black vote ...
No one is going to vote for her that did not vote for Mr. Obama , and a whole lot less Obama voters will vote for her ...
She has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party ...
Best case scenario : Obama gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the Democrats gain a greater foothold of the US Senate and increase their collective mass in the US Congress .
Worst case scenario : George W. Bush II ( any Republican candidate other then Huntsman , Romney , or Ron Paul ) will take the election .
Then that means the Republicans would likely further gain in Congress and even the Senate perhaps .
Then the country slides right back into the deepest of recessions .
I suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates , and especially the ones you call tea baggers .
Actually , I think you are wrong on the moderate / independent voter turnout , too , but I could be wrong .
I 'm expecting a fairly good anti Obama turnout amongst that group .
I could accept Hillary .
On the other hand , Obama stepping aside seems even less likely than Cain giving up .
I guess that in summary , I 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next five years .
Have you heard of their society falling apart ? Of course not .
I think with NY , then CA , it will rapidly spread across the country .
You ca n't stop this train !
@jcboy , I hope that the US Congress addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey moot by making same sex marriage a national law .
Whether one 's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state is another matter .
The citizens created the damned government , their child . David
Accidents happen , but this particular area may need additional regulation ( such as a minimum altitude requirement for the tourist helicopters ) .
My husband , our kids , and myself were spending a day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kids , our long - time friends .
At some point we came across a huge fallen tree , and our friend L. climbed on it and started walking up .
Our 11 year - old son followed him , but L. suddenly realized they wo n't be able to get down that easily .
He turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too .
Our son stopped but did n't get out of his way at once .
He was having fun , and we had to tell him 2 more times , and then he obeyed .
After that L. got back down , and he suddenly grabbed our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might , yelling at him .
A 215lbs 38 year old man could have easily injured him .
Fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened .
We are in deep shock , we never hit our children .
Why ca n't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you do n't want them hitting your kids ever again .
I suppose you could add probation ( but that is just a replacement for jail time ) .
If I was angry enough to start down this path I would n't worry about where it ended up .
I would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again .
He did n't hurt your child physically , so it was the lesser form of assault ( assault causing physical harm is seen as more serious . )
You certainly could file a police report ....
I do n't know the law where you are , here , it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man , making it clear that ( if your description is accurate ) he had committed an offence , but you could decide against filing charges .
here , being extra - familial , and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to hm again , they would simply hand it to police .
If you release a legal genie from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the genie does .
For instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement .
It might go to court .
I 'd personally not choose to do it tthat way ... though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be had in your area .
I 'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him .
However , my concern would be how he treats his own kids .
If you have evidence that he assaults his own kids , I 'd be considering a chold protection notification .
I am a 25 year old woman , and I have been in a 2 year relationship with a 37 year old married man .
He has 2 kids one , from his marriage and one from a previous relationship .
He has been planning to get a divorce since the first day we met ,
He is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye .
He was having sex chats with a lady he met on facebook from Sweden ,
I felt and still feel betrayed and I ca n't trust him .
Do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do ?
Personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get .
I have little or no pity for you .
But , you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him .
Then why do n't you think about looking for someone who is not attached .
Your odds of finding happiness are a bit better going that route in my opinion .
