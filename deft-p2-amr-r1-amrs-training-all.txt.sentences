A United Nation nuclear team will make a week - long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state 's controversial nuclear site .
Government sources said on January 7 , 2002 that a united nation nuclear team will make a week - long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state 's controversial nuclear site .
The upcoming visit is viewed as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) drive to clarify North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
A government source stated the visit by a group of IAEA safety experts is scheduled to last for a week beginning January 12 , 2002 .
The source stated that the inspection would focus on an isotope production laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear complex which is north of North Korea 's capital Pyongyang .
The IAEA tour of the isotope production laboratory will unlikely give a full picture of North Korea 's suspected nuclear weapons ambitions .
The tour was a surprise offer made by North Korea in November 2001 .
IAEA accepted North Korea 's proposal last month but cautioned that the proposal is not a breakthrough .
IAEA also stated the lab is not one of the frozen facilities it wants to look into .
IAEA is based in Vienna and is the UN 's nuclear supervisor .
North Korea has denied the IAEA full access to its facilities .
North Korea froze its suspected nuclear weapons program at Yongbyon in exchange for receiving two nuclear reactors producing less weapons - grade plutonium under a 1994 accord with the United States .
The 4.6 - billion - dollar project was due to be completed by 2003 .
Delays have pushed back the finish until at least 2008 .
Pyongyang insists it will allow full IAEA inspections only when a significant portion of the project as defined in the 1994 accord is completed .

South Koreans rallied on January 11 , 2002 in support of their right to eat dog meat .
They threatened an Internet war as part of a campaign to defend the traditional cuisine .
A nationalist group has vowed cyber hostilities against U.S. based media company Warner Bros . and one of France 's state - run television channels .
The activists accuse the organizations of being culturally - biased and insulting .
A South Korean group has announced a campaign backed by food scientists to promote the eating of dog meat .
This announcement was in response to increasing foreign criticism of the way dogs are slaughtered in South Korea .
The killing of dogs for restaurants has become a more popular topic than the football World Cup finals .
The World Cup finals are to be co - hosted by South Korea and Japan this year .
The debate was partly fueled by FIFA , football 's international governing body .
FIFA urged South Korea to prevent the inhumane killing of dogs .
South Koreans are angered by the international pressure on their traditional cuisine .
The organizers of South Korean website antijapan . wo . ro vowed to paralyze the websites of Warner Bros . ( www.wpix.com ) and the French state television network ( www.francetv.fr ) on January 19 , 2002 .
The organizers of the South Korean website accused the broadcasters of falsely describing South Koreans and their food culture as barbaric .
The anti - Japan group stated that South Korean culture is under attack .
The statement was made to gain supporters to join the lobbying .
Cyber warfare has become a common weapon for South Koreans .
They are one of the most Internet savvy nations in the world .
South Korean cyber campaigners disabled Japanese education ministry websites last year in a protest against history books accused of skimming Japan 's wartime record in Asia .
The nationalist group was formed to campaign against Japan .
The group said the foreign broadcasters are battering the eating dogmeat culture and that it is insulting behavior .
It tramples on a tradition of one country .
The group said the foreign broadcasters do not show any remorse for their culture of eating snails and horses .
The cyber attack is to show the power of South Koreans and Asians against the West 's sense of superiority and ignorance of South Korea 's history .
Another group said they will launch an association next Monday of around 100 dog meat restaurant owners in the Seoul region and hold a seminar to promote the dish .
Food scientist at Chung Chong College an Yong - geun said he would introduce some 350 different kinds of culinary art with dog meat .
French actress - turned activist Brigitte Bardot and other animal rights campaigners call to stop the South Korean practice of eating dogs .
FIFA president Sepp Blatter sent a letter last November to South Korea 's World Cup organizing committee calling for immediate and decisive measures against cruelty to dogs .
It was ahead of the World Cup which starts May 31 , 2002 .
Head of the Korean Football Association and a FIFA vice president Chung Mong - Joon said FIFA should not intervene in the eating habits of a sovereign nation .
South Korean officials said most dogs used for eating were killed instantly by electrocution .
Activists contend many slaughterhouses in the countryside are not controlled .
They strangle dogs , hang them by a rope and beat them in line with traditional practice to make the meat more tender .
Dog restaurants were told to close or go into the backstreets when Seoul hosted the 1988 Olympics .
No similar move is planned for the World Cup .
The authorities say the practice is slowly disappearing in Korea .
A recent survey stated that about one million dogs are sold every year for food in South Korea and 92 percent of men aged 20 and above and 68 percent of adult women have tasted dog meat .

Tariq Jamil stated that he would examine if the baned literature is still available in the market despite the ban .
The 2 hardline militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir are the Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammad .
The Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammad are still distributing their message through a range of publications and magazines easily available in Karachi .
Other groups linked to terrorism and included on the United States Terrorist Exclusion List are also publishing regular newspapers and journals containing rhetoric that is against Western countries and calls for war in the name of Islam .
Qari Mohammad Zafar stated that his elders urged him to read about Jihad through the Islam daily published by the Al-Rashid Trust and Lashkar - i - Taiba 's zarb - e - Taiba weekly .

Police officer Mohammad Iqbal stated that the police so far have not received any instructions to take action against any banned religious extremist publications .
Analysts stated that the Pakistani government may have trouble explaining the Pakistani government 's reasoning if the banned religious extremist groups ' publications are suddenly removed from the newsstands because the Pakistani Government generally supports the freedom of the press .
A reporter who did not want to be named from the publication of the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust stated that it would not be easy for the Pakistani government to ban the religious extremist publications and make over 500 employees jobless .

Canadian government 's warning of al-Qaeda 's capability to launch a cyberattack causes various industries to review their preparedness .
Critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers cite close work with Government to remain aware of threats and to update accordingly .
A recent government warning that al-Qaeda terrorists could launch a cyberattack on Canadian interests or critical infrastructure has caused many concerned industries to review their security systems .
Vice President of Canadian electricity Association Francis Bradley stated that the company has a warning system for both physical and cyberattacks .
Bradley stated that the company has been significantly focused on prevention of cyberattacks .
In a recent interview Bradley stated that many utility firms perform a brief review of their multi - tiered response systems after such warnings are issued .
The warning from the Canadian Department of National Defense 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service was quietly released on 20 December 2001 and cited no specific threat .
Director of threat analysis at the Canadian Department of National Defense 's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service Brenda hensler - Hobbs stated that following the attacks of 11 September 2001 the Canadian Government specifically examined the potential cyber - capability of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden 's followers .
Hensler - Hobbs stated that the Canadian government has no knowledge of Al-Qaeda having engaged in cyberattacks in the past but that leader bin Laden has suggested that if he chose to launch cyberattacks he could have the means available to him .
In summary of the recent warning stating that such an attack could be executed in the very near future hensler - Hobbs stated that bin Laden 's location was irrelevant because bin Laden possesses the money and supporters necessary to have such an attack executed by others .
A number of al-Qaeda militants including Millennium plot bomber Ahmed Ressam are known to have remained in Canada .
Many are located in Montreal .
Hensler - Hobbs stated that the proliferation and availability of Hacker tools and the low skill level needed to conduct cyberattacks demonstrate the ease of launching an attack anywhere .
Hensler - Hobbs cited the example of the Montreal - based Hacker known as mafiaboy who attacked U.S. websites including Amazon.com in 2000 .
Many think that security must be improved at North American critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers and the financial services sector that are largely interconnected .
Many businesses began preparing for cyber incidents before the year 2000 .
A separate report issued recently by the U.S. government - funded research group computer science and telecommunications Board stated that cyber security needs considerable improvement .
For example , according to a Canadian government estimate the love bug launched in May 2000 caused 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in damage and disrupted Canadian government systems .
Bell Canada spokesman Andrew Cole stated that Bell Canada is prepared and remains prepared for various potential situations and scenarios .
Cole stated --
Bell Canada works very closely with the Government and the private sector to be aware of security concerns and to update accordingly .
Bell Canada worked closely with U.S. officials and firms after the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
Bell Canada provides a total of 26 million phone and Internet connections to a nation of 30 million people .
Bradley stated --
Electricity firms have strong warning systems that are coordinated by the North American Electric reliability Council .
There has not been a cyber event that has resulted in a loss of power for utility customers .
There is little possibility that a cyberattack would disable a North American electric grid .
Electric companies are well prepared and are making all preparations required to be ready for any physical or cyberattack .
The North American Electric reliability Council 's 30 largest utility companies went on their highest alert on September 11 and many still have an increased security presence in effect and plan to extend it further .

Russia 's military authorities criticized Kamchatenergo Power Company for imposing a shutdown on supplies to a command center that guides military satellites in orbit and contributes to systems controlling the international space station .
The Kamchatenergo company disconnected a major control center of the Russian space forces located in Kamchatka early Saturday , the Russian Space Forces press service said .
Kamchatenergo feeds power to the vast Kamchatka peninsula in Russia 's far east .
A statement from the Russian Space Forces press services on 020126 called the action a direct violation of government decrees on defense facilities and stated that it could have led to the loss of a spacecraft costing hundreds of millions of rubles .
The monitoring center is a key element in maintaining Russia 's satellite network in orbit and plays a part in operations of the international space platform Alfa .
Officials at the command center took urgent measures to use reserve power units to keep the system functioning and to temporarily provide residential centers with electricity .
Several other military bases and strategic defense units were affected .
The State power monopoly United energy services and its regional subsidiary Kamchatenergo launched a program of power cuts to long - term debtors on 020125 .
United energy services argues that non - payment of bills has prevented it from maintaining supplies .
The Russian Space Forces , the space branch of Russia 's armed forces , expressed alarm at the prospect of further power cuts resulting from delays in Federal budget resources reaching local authorities on time .

The Kamchatka Command Center maintains Russia 's satellite network in orbit .
The Kamchatka command center plays a role in ISS operations .
cutting power to command centers could pose dangers for Russian space installations .
Power cuts could lead to a failure of all work with space craft .
The ISS could function for an orbit or two without ground control by using standby systems .
A total unexpected loss of power during control of military equipment could be catastrophic .
The Government or UES or the Ministry of Defense must resolve the issue .
The Kamchatenergo company feeds power to Kamchatka Peninsula .

An Australian jury found that an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official was defamed in a book about alleged Olympic corruption in which he was depicted as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .
A New South Wales Supreme Court jury took just over 2 hours on 020201 to find Gafur Rakhimov had been libelled in a book the Great Olympic swindle which alleges Olympic corruption .
Gafur Rakhimov is an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official and was depicted in the book as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .
The Great Olympic swindle was written by British journalist Andrew Jennings and published by Simon and Schuster .
The Rakhimov case will now go to a single judge to hear defences and decide any damages to be awarded to Rakhimov .
The Great Olympic swindle implied that Gafur Rakhimov had been engaged in fraud , prostitution , assassination , gun running and plutonium smuggling .
The book also implied that the businessman was a gangster in the Soviet black economy and had traded sporting medals for bribes .
Rakhimov was Vice - President of the Olympic Council of Asia and an Executive Member of the International Amateur Boxing Association .
Rakhimov was also said to have bribed members of the International Amateur Boxing Federation in the vote for the Federation Presidency .
Jennings is a long - time critic of the International Olympic Committee .
The 020201 verdict followed 2 defamation actions brought last year by Rakhimov against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) and Jennings and against the Sydney Morning Herald ( SMH ) and Jennings .
A jury found in the case involving the ABC that ABC 's flagship current affairs program four corners had implied Rakhimov knew some of the world 's most dangerous criminals and was suspected by the FBI of drug trafficking .
That Panel found those insinuations were not defamatory and threw out the case against the ABC and Jennings .
The SMH and Jennings were then sued over 3 articles published in the lead - up to the 000000 Olympics .
The jury in that case found Rakhimov had been painted as a major international criminal and had been defamed .

OSCE urges permanent end to Afghan terrorism and drug - trafficking to create long - term stability in Central Asia .
Expert states that cultivation of opium and drug trafficking are deeply entrenched in Afghanistan and will be impossible to eradicate .
On 10 February 2002 an official with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was quoted as stating that long - term stability in Central Asia depends on eradicating post - Taliban Afghan terrorism and drug - trafficking .
The OSCE envoy in neighboring Tajikistan Marc Gilbert stated to the government weekly national gazette that there are now hopes that Afghanistan will develop its democratic institutions and end terrorism and drug - smuggling resulting in greater stability in Central Asia .
Gilbert stated that the post - Soviet republics in central Asia fought terrorism by giving material and other necessary help to the international anti - terrorist coalition in the war against Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime .
Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan share a border with Afghanistan and have experienced raids by Taliban - backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Neighboring Kyrgyzstan has also experienced raids by Taliban - backed Islamic militants in recent years .
Kazakhstan also became a key U.S. partner in the Afghan war opening its airspace to military overflights .
Turkmenistan maintained a more neutral stance .
Turkmenistan borders Afghanistan .
Gilbert stated that Tajikistan 's positive and responsible approach to the crisis in Afghanistan has significantly improved the country 's image internationally .
Tajik government expert and head of the Tajik Drug Control Agency Vladimir Rakhmonov stated on 10 February 2002 that the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan had failed to stop drug trafficking across the border into Tajikistan .
Rakhmonov stated to Interfax --
Opium and heroin are a form of hard - currency reserve for Afghanistan .
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan has been concealed so securely that it will be impossible to uncover .
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan resumed during a brief hiatus in the anti - terrorist operation .
In 2001 Tajik law - enforcement agencies and Russian border guards seized 8.8 tons of drugs including 4.2 tons of heroin .
This represented a 26 percent increase overall in 2001 with 3 times the amount of heroin .
Suggestions that there are no longer drug lords in Afghanistan and that drug traffic into Tajikistan has been eradicated are unrealistic and false .
Many years would be needed to convert Afghanistan 's agriculture historically specialized in the growing of raw opium .
Cultivation of raw opium provided the only source of income for much of the rural population .
Tajikistan 's 780 - mile border with Afghanistan is patrolled by approximately 11000 Russian soldiers under a 1992 agreement between the Russian and Tajik Governments .

Afghan officials conducted talks with Russian officials asking for assistance in stopping Afghanistan 's large illegal opium and heroin trade .
Afghanistan seeks to end poppy harvesting and increase border control .
March 1 , 2002 interim interior minister of Afghanistan Yunus Qanooni asked Russian officials to assist in combating the drugs trade and establishing security in Afghanistan .
Qanooni is a member of the Northern Alliance .
Qanooni told Russian Deputy Minister for Emergency Situations Yury Vorobyov --
Unfortunately over the past six years , the rule of the Taliban turned Afghanistan into a center of terrorism and drugs .
The struggle against terrorism and against drugs , and the establishment of security is a priority for the Administration of Afghanistan .
But combating terrorism and drugs requires joint efforts .
Peace and stability in Afghanistan is not only in the interests of the Afghani people and nation but of all the countries in the region .
Afghanistan 's interim government stated that it would take firm measures very quickly to prevent the harvest of poppy in the wake of the Taliban regime 's fall late last year .
Leader of Afghanistan 's interim government Hamid Karzai said the fight against poppy harvesting and the lucrative trafficking of opium and heroin will be a top priority .
The anti - drug effort is strongly supported by Western countries , whose populations are a major market for heroin and opium from Afghanistan .
February 28 , 2002 Kabul officials announced that Afghan police are creating their first anti - narcotics units with the help of the United Nations due to concern that the country could again become a major producer of opium .
February 28 , 2002 Qanooni stated in talks with Russian Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov that Afghanistan 's main task is to prevent future drugs production .
Qanooni outlined a three - stage plan of action --
Afghan authorities will seek to ban poppy harvesting .
Afghan authorities will strengthen the borders around Afghanistan .
Afghan authorities will cooperate with the security forces of neighboring states .
Afghanistan is thought to be responsible for 75 percent of the world 's opium and 80 percent of the heroin traded illegally in Europe .
Approximately 11000 Russian guards patrol the 1200 - kilometre ( 750 - mile ) border between Russia and Afghanistan under a 1992 agreement signed by Moscow and Dushanbe .
The Northern Alliance opposes the Taliban but tolerated the harvest of poppy in territory it controlled .

South Korea 's defense ministry under attack in parliament over allegations it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for multi - billion - dollar fighter project .
Newspaper reports reveal that French - made plane was rated higher in air force evaluations and that the Government is instead responding to political pressure from the U.S. and Boeing .
South Korea 's Defense Ministry came under attack in Parliament on 04 March 2002 over allegations that it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for a multi - billion - dollar fighter project .
Ruling and opposition lawmakers criticized the Ministry as newspapers reported that the French - made fighter Rafale had scored the highest marks of any of the 4 contenders in field tests performed by South Korean Air Force evaluators .
The 3.2 billion U.S. dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles .
Award of the contract was temporarily suspended in February 2002 after the prices offered by 4 bidders were judged too high .
South Korea 's defense ministry promised to conclude its first - stage appraisal by the end of March 2002 .
There has also been much newspaper speculation that the South Korean government might yield to U.S. pressure to buy Boeing 's aged F - 15 k.
Speculation grew in February 2002 when Defense Minister Kim Dong - Shin stressed that South Korea should consider security ties with the United States in the project .
The other competing planes are the Dassault firm 's Rafale , the Eurofighter Consortium 's typhoon 2000 and the Russian Su - 32 made by Sukhoi .
Dassault is seeking its first foreign order for the Rafale .
Kang Chang - Sung of the opposition Grand National Party expressed doubt of the fairness of the evaluation methods stating that his party suspects that the Defense Ministry has political reasons to select the F - 15 k.
The ruling Millennium Democratic Party also accused the Ministry of favoring the F - 15 k despite the defense chief 's insistence that there was no favoritism toward Boeing .
Kim stated --
There has been no pressure from the United States .
There would be an investigation into how classified documents had been leaked .
The Defense Ministry was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the Air Force 's evaluation of the Rafale as excellent in all categories .
Newspapers stated that the F - 15 k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only 30 percent of core technology requirements .
Newspapers stated that the Eurofighter was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the Rafale also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability .
The Su - 35 placed fourth with ratings of ordinary in all five categories .
Rafale reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for South Korea 's aerospace industry .
The Ministry stated that the air force was just 1 of 4 evaluations .
Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward Boeing noting that the evaluation was revised in February 2002 to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer .
The English - language Korea Herald newspaper stated that this revision gives an advantage to Boeing which has been reluctant to transfer core technology .
The Korea Herald stated that when evaluators were conducting their first - stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points .
The Korea Herald stated that critics say Boeing would benefit most from the points minimum because it would gain fewer points than Dassault in terms of technology transfer and subcontracts .

A senior South Korean minister on Friday warned that there could be a new crisis this year over inspections of the rival North 's nuclear program .
Senior South Korean minister Jeong Se - hyun on 020329 warned that tensions could rise because North Korea wants inspections of its nuclear facilities delayed .
Unification Minister Jeong is the South Korean government 's chief policymaker for relations with North Korea .
Jeong said in a lecture on South Korea and US relations with North Korea that there was some talk in the United States that the nuclear inspection in North Korea should be carried out in 020800 .
North Korea 's suggestion is that the inspection should be delayed until 050000 .
Jeong said that a crisis could come in 020800 on the Korean peninsula if this issue becomes an international point of contention .
Following Jeong 's comments another senior government official sought to play down Jeong 's remarks about the looming troubles .
The unnamed official told the Yonhap national news agency that talk of pressing for IAEA inspections in 020800 had come only from private researchers in the United States .
The official said it was speculation that the North Korean government thinks the inspections should be delayed until 050000 .
Top South Korean envoy Lim Won - dong intends to raise international concerns about the North 's nuclear and missile programs when he goes to Pyongyang 020403 .
Lim is a special advisor to President Kim Dae - jung on national security and foreign affairs .
Lim has also warned of a looming nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .
Military officials said Lim intimated the problems could be as serious as a 940000 nuclear standoff over North Korea 's suspected nuclear weapons development that came close to conflict .
The North Korean government agreed to freeze the North Korean nuclear program under an accord with a US - led international consortium .
The consortium is to build 2 light water nuclear reactors that produce less weapons grade fuel than North Korea 's old graphite reactors and provide substitute fuel until they are built .
The original 030000 target date for completion has been put back at least 5 years because of major political and construction delays .
The 940000 Accord stipulated that the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) must be allowed to inspect North Korea 's old facilities to see if plutonium has been processed before the core facilities of the new reactors are installed .

The number of heroin addicts in Tajikistan has vastly increased over the past five years due to drug trafficking between Afghanistan and Russia and Europe .
The number of heroin addicts in Tajikistan has vastly increased over the past five years due to drug trafficking between Afghanistan and Europe .
The majority of the heroin is grown in neighboring Afghanistan .
Afghanistan is the world 's top opium producer .
Tajikistan shares a 1300 - kilometer ( 800 - mile ) border with Afghanistan and has become a transit point for heroin being trafficked into Russia and Europe .
In 2001 the Russian army and Tajik police confiscated nearly 9 tons of drugs and arrested more than 2000 people .
The Russian army guards Tajikistan 's border with Afghanistan .
The majority of Tajikistan 's heroin addicts live in cities and are aged between 18 and 25 .
75 percent of Tajikistan 's population lives in rural areas , where heroin addicts are frequently ostracized .
Head of a public drug clinic in Dushanbe , Tajikistan Andrei Onishchenko , stated --
There are 5000 heroin addicts officially registered in Tajikistan , compared with 57 in 1997 .
The actual figure is seven times greater than the official number .
The low cost and availability of heroin are among the causes of the addiction problem .
One dose of heroin costs less than a dollar in Tajikistan , which is less than the price of a bottle of the local vodka .
an addict who has been using heroin for 2 years needs to use 3 grams of heroin every 24 hours .
3 grams of heroin costs 70 somonis or 30 dollars .
an addict is willing to commit any crime to pay for heroin .
Afghan heroin is the strongest in the world because it is made from poppies cultivated at high altitudes and therefore subjected to high doses of ultra - violet light .
A person who takes a daily dose of Afghan heroin has a life expectancy of between 5 and 7 years and many commit suicide before that .
The Tajik State pays 25 dirams ( a few cents ) per day for every person in the rehabilitation clinics .
The percentage of relapses is very high due to the lack of followup treatment and unemployment among young people .
Head of a Tajik government agency that fights drug trafficking Avaz yuldachev stated that heroin users are ill and need treatment .
Anvar , a 14 - year - old boy from Dushanbe , used heroin for three years before being hospitalized in Onishchenko 's drug clinic .
Anvar said --
He sniffed a white substance he found in his backyard and was unable to stop .
He stopped going to school .
He stole from the local market to get money for more heroin .
Drug traffickers face the death penalty under Tajik law .
Tajikistan has 6.2 million inhabitants .

AFP , members of international and local press , and United Nations representatives and diplomats witnessed Myanmar destroy illicit drugs the authorities captured .
Min said Myanmar would be one of the richest countries in the region if they were as corrupt as outsiders claimed .
Hla Min stated that illicit drugs worth some 50 billion dollars have been destroyed by authorities since 1974 .
Min said it was enough to pay Myanmar 's national debt ten times over .
Drug - burning ceremonies are regular events in Myanmar .
Critics argue that it does not reflect the massive drug industry in the country .
Resident Representative of the UN 's Drug Control Program ( UNDCP ) Jean - Luc Lemahieu said this one is different .
Almost 102 tons of poppy seeds were burnt in the capital of Myanmar 's northern Shan state at this ceremony .
The ceremony also included 249 kilograms of opium , 102 kilograms of morphine powder , three kilograms of solid morphine and various precursor chemicals .
Lemahieu said that this ceremony had less processed opium and heroin than opium seeds .
It made it more symbolic and indicated the willingness of those directly involved to eliminate the opium .
The destruction forms part of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control 's project new destiny .
It aims to prevent poppy cultivation by distributing seeds for substitution crops .
Farmers have been asked to grow seven kinds of alternative crops across 21,969 acres ( 8,891 hectares ) of land instead of opium .
Global narcotics authorities declared Myanmar the world 's largest producer of opium in 2001 .
They accounted for as much as 60 percent of global supply .
Myanmar beat Afghanistan because the Taliban militia 's enforced ban on opium poppies decreased Afghan production by 90 percent .
Critics said the Myanmar regime overlooks much of the production and trafficking in drugs by ethnic insurgent groups .
In particular the largest armed drug militia in the world the United Wa State Army .
Myanmar 's Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing said the success of project new destiny is evidenced by the tons of poppy seeds that have been turned in rather than seized .
Hlaing stated his confidence in the drug scourge that threatens the world will not find a place in Myanmar if the local population is committed to this sort of cooperation .
Lauk Kai is one of the regime 's showpieces for its previous crop substitution programs .
It has expanses of rubber trees , fruit orchards and paddy where poppies used to thrive .
The poppies yielded the raw ingredient for heroin .
Lauk Kai is located in the infamous Golden Triangle .
Reformed drug lord and leader of the Kokang phone Kyar Shin pledged commitment to the government program .
The Kokang comprise the majority of the population in Myanmar .
Phone Kyar Shin predicts that starting today there will be no destruction ceremony in the future because no more poppy will be grown .
Phone Kyar Shin said this at another ceremony that destroyed more than 12 tons of poppy seed .
Phone Kyar Shin appealed for help from the international community .
The international community is reluctant to give help .
Phone Kyar Shin requested the distinguished guests to understand Myanmar 's situation more and give practical advice and support .
UNDCP 's Lemahieu when asked by AFP what impact project New Destiny had on the international community hoped it would have a positive impact and that some additional funds would come forward .
Lemahieu said so much depends on the political situation in this country .
There is hope for further political change following the May 6 release of pro - democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from 19 months house arrest .
The regime seeks the United States approval for the project .
Its global announcement comes via the regime 's newly - appointed public relations firm in Washington .

Ecological organization Greenpeace stated on June 21 , 2002 that Russia helped Iran to develop nuclear weapons by building Iran 's Bushehr atomic power station .
The Russian branch of Greenpeace distributed a report at a press conference of Russia 's atomic energy ministry .
The ministry conceded that the Russo - Iranian accord on the plant 's construction does not require the repatriation of the nuclear fuel .
The report stated that the recycling of nuclear fuel from Bushehr is not mentioned in the accord between the Russian and Iranian governments on the construction of the plant .
Greenpeace member Vladimir Chuprov said the ministry had practically admitted that Iran will not return to Russia the spent nuclear fuel from the power station and Russia 's only use for Iran is to equip itself with nuclear weapons .
The atomic energy ministry confirmed the report 's existence and strongly denied Greenpeace 's accusations .
Ministry spokesman Nikolai Shingarev told AFP that Russia would only supply nuclear fuel to Iran on condition that it be returned to Russia after its use .
Shingarev said Russia is currently in negotiations with Iran .
This issue will be settled before the power station comes into operation .
Shingarev said the accord on Bushehr was signed before Russia passed a law permitting the import of nuclear waste last year .
This explains why the accord makes no mention of the return of the fuel .
Shingarev said it is very difficult to make a nuclear weapon from the plutonium in this fuel .
The United States and Israel fear that the Russian - Iranian nuclear cooperation could enable Tehran to acquire the technology needed to build nuclear weapons .
Russia dismisses this accusation .
Iran ordered the power station in 1994 at a cost of nearly 800 million dollars ( 860 million euros ) from Russia .
Iran has said the plant is being built only for civilian energy purposes and allows regular inspections of Bushehr by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Experts say Bushehr could in theory become operational as early as September 2003 .
Currently it is equipped with a single reactor .
German group Siemens pulled out of the long - standing project at the request of the German government after Iran 's 1979 Islamic Revolution .
US President George W. Bush raised the US 's concerns about Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran at the summit in Moscow last month between Bush and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin .

Malaysia proposes expansion of anti - terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to entire ASEAN .
Terrorism is expanding across Southeast Asia .
The Malaysian Government proposes the expansion of an anti - terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to encompass the remainder of Southeast Asia .
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar stated that other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) will be encouraged to accede to the pact at talks next week with ASEAN foreign ministers in Brunei .
Syed Hamid stated that Thailand , Laos and Singapore had expressed interest in joining the pact .
Malaysian defense analyst dzirhan mahadzir stated --
Cooperation by poorer countries may be stymied by financial constraints and a perception that terrorism does not directly affect these countries .
An ASEAN pact is beneficial in the long - term but will be difficult to implement because national security issues and interstate rivalry may make some of ASEAN 's 10 members wary to divulge information .
ASEAN must agree on a definition of terrorism to identify the common enemy .
20020500 senior ASEAN members Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines signed an anti - terror security pact intended to initiate the eradication of terrorism from the region .
The 3 countries share sea borders frequently used by pirates and criminals in evading pursuing troops .
The pact includes plans to trace and freeze terror funds and exchange information to curb cross - border piracy , drug trafficking , illegal entry and illegal trafficking of women and children .
Syed Hamid stated that after 20010911 countries should exchange information that may affect transnational crime such as funds of terrorists that may be kept in other countries or third party information to combat the greater threat of international terrorism .
Mushahid Ali of the Singapore - based Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies stated --
The trilateral pact between Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines constituted a constructive first step .
Indonesia and other ASEAN members must more proactively monitor terrorist activities and establish a concrete mechanism among national agencies for the protracted conflict .
20020500 ASEAN security ministers at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur failed to agree on a definition of terrorism but agreed to increase cooperation among State enforcement agencies and endorsed the use of detention without trial for suspected militants in Malaysia and Singapore .
Objections were raised concerning Malaysia 's proposal to include State terrorism in the definition .
Dzirhan stated --
The agreement among Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines may have been aimed at ingratiating the countries to the US rather than combating terrorism .
Since the pact was signed no progress has occurred .
The creation of a formalized security structure in combating terror will be decelerated by the ASEAN 's model of acting on consensus .
Officials stated that after the meeting in Brunei 20020728-20020801 ASEAN and its major western trading partners are expected to demand freezing of terror funds and stronger counter - terrorism cooperation .
Dozens of suspected terrorists allegedly linked to al-Qaeda in Malaysia , Singapore and the Philippines have revealed the existence of a regional Islamic militant group called the Jemaah Islamiyah , which also operates in Indonesia .
Southeast Asia is now suspected as a potential new haven for al-Qaeda operatives escaping US and allied attacks in Afghanistan and elsewhere .

Atomic Energy Agency director States it would be difficult for Iraq to conceal a nuclear weapons program if international inspectors were allowed to return .
Inspectors would perform various tests , visits , and interviews and their presence alone in the country would be a deterrent .
On 18 October 2002 International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) director Mohamed ElBaradei stated it is unlikely that Iraq could conceal a nuclear weapons program if it allowed international inspectors to return .
ElBaradei stated that once inspectors were working in Iraq their presence alone would be a deterrent to developing nuclear weapons .
ElBaradei stated to reporters at his headquarters in Vienna --
It is difficult to conceal a nuclear program if thorough inspections are performed because nuclear products always have a signature .
Traces are always visible if highly enriched uranium or plutonium were used .
ElBaradei stated that inspectors would perform environmental sampling , gamma radiation surveys from helicopters , internal periodic visits to all capable sites and interviews with all former nuclear scientists to confirm that they are not working in the nuclear program .
ElBaradei stated that the IAEA could not give a 100 percent guarantee but that the presence of inspectors would be a good deterrent and a good mechanism for detection .
ElBaradei stated --
It is necessary to control imports to Iraq because of the risk that Iraq is receiving nuclear material from outside the country .
There must be physical protection of all nuclear material particularly in the former Soviet Union .
There must be strong unanimous support by the UN Security Council to force Iraq to comply with IAEA inspection .
The IAEA must be given as much intelligence information as possible to guide inspectors to anything that should be inspected or to any item hidden from inspectors .
The Security Council has been meeting in open session to discuss the Iraq issue before the vote on conditions under which UN weapons inspectors will return to Baghdad to verify Iraqi assertions that it does not possess nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .
UN weapons inspectors departed Baghdad in 1998 .

Bangladesh opposition claims a crime crackdown being carried out by the army is becoming political witchhunt , and human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being violated .
Bangladesh 's main opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed said 021102 that an army crackdown on crime was turning into a political witchhunt and targeting her Awami League party .
Troops were ordered into the streets more than 2 weeks ago to eliminate rampant crime but human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being trampled .
Newspapers and rights groups put the toll of those who have died in police and military custody at 16 .
Officials say more than 3400 people have been taken into custody since the crackdown began 021017 .
The government has confirmed the deaths of 12 people due to heart attacks .
Relatives allege some suspects have been tortured in custody .
The US government and London - based Amnesty International have also expressed concern about the custodial deaths .
Amnesty urged a prompt and fair investigation by an independent body into the deaths .
Sheikh Hasina told reporters at the airport on her return from a private trip to the United States and Europe that initially it appeared to be a neutral anti - crime drive and the opposition Awami League party welcomed it .
Hasina said the crackdown is gradually turning into one to eliminate the Opposition .
Hasina wants the military to arrest real criminals and not violate Bangladesh 's constitution and human rights because of concern about such violations in the name of anti - crime drive .
Sheikh Hasina said the military has to operate within the laws of the land as no one is above the law .
Police said the army hadon 021101 arrested former state minister and Awami League lawmaker talukder Abdul khaleque in southwestern Khulna city soon after he spoke at a news conference against the deployment .
The Daily Star newspaper reported that an imam and a local leader of fundamentalist group Jamaat - e - Islami were also arrested on 021101 in Khulna .
Former minister and Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Sheikh Hasina 's Political Secretary ex - minister Saber Hossain Chowdhury were arrested 021000 along with independent MP Hemayet Ullah aurango .
Selim , Chowdhury and aurango are being detained under the strict 740000 Special Powers Act allowing detention for 120 days without charge .
Sheikh Hasina questioned how 3 of the Awami League party 's ex - ministers could be terrorists .
Hasina was apparently unaware of the claims of the arrest of the Jamaat leader when adding that it is an open secret that the Jamaat - e - Islami and the Jamaat - e - Islami student wing have weapons and wondering why none of the Jamaat - e - Islami has been arrested so far .
Hasina said the Awami League party would raise the issue when parliament reconvenes 021114 .
Bangladesh 's Prime Minister Khaleda Zia 's Islamist - allied government includes 2 cabinet ministers from the Jamaat .
Zia 's administration denies the drive is politically biased and stresses that activists from ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) have also been detained .
A young BNP activist died 021101 in a hospital after being interrogated by the army .
Police said the activist was wanted in a number of cases .

The Russian government hailed cooperation of Arab countries in fighting terrorism and said not one Arab state backed the Chechen separatists who are accused of waging a terrorist campaign .
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) Secretary General Abdel Rahman al-Attiya held talks on 021104 .
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko said afterward that not a single Arab country supports rebels in Chechnya .
Yakovenko said the Russian Government finds it inadmissible to link individual States or religions with terrorism or extremism and is grateful to those Arab states which are trying to cooperate with Russian law enforcement agencies to cut channels for funding terrorist organizations .
The Russian government has consistently sought to portray its campaign against a separatist insurgency in Chechnya as part of the global war on terrorism and says that rebel groups are receiving backing from the terrorist Al-Qaeda network and from shadowy Islamic radical groups based in countries such as Saudi Arabia .
A senior Kremlin official said last week that the Russian Government might ask the GCC State Qatar to extradite Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev .
Yandarbiyev is a former Chechen Vice - President and aide to rebel president Aslan Maskhadov .
The Russian government accuses Yandarbiyev of involvement in the 041000 hostage - taking in a Moscow theater .
Russian government spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Qatar 's response would demonstrate the extent of that country 's willingness to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism .
Yakovenko said that stronger ties between Russia and the GCC States could play a special role in combating international terrorism .
Ivanov said al-Attiya 's visit will contribute to increased cooperation between the Russian government and the six Arab monarchies of the Gulf region .
Ivanov said the Russian government wanted to strengthen its ties with the Gulf countries and that these ties have begun to strengthen recently .
Ivanovalso said the Russian government would like to develop them further and particularly in areas of mutual interest .
The Russian government has traditionally been close to the Arab side in the Middle East conflict and has spoken strongly against US armed intervention against Iraq in the stand - off over disarmament .
Yakovenko said that Al-Attiya 's talks with Russian government officials 021104 and 021105 were likely to focus on oil issues and noted that both the Russian government and the Gulf countries are interested in stable world prices .
Yakovenko said the main emphasis of the talks will be on Russia 's possible involvement in the implementation of regional projects run by the Council and said that there will be particular emphasis on finding peaceful , political and diplomatic ways to settle the Iraqi issue .
Al-Attiya also plans to hold talks with economic ministers and senior officials such as the head of the Chamber of Commerce Yevgeny Primakov and the Chairman of the Russian employers ' association Arkady Volsky .

Tanzanian Vice President Ali Mohamed Sheni said on November 12 , 2002 that Africa needs its own health forum to create research priorities to effectively combat disease on the continent .
Sheni stated that Africa will find it difficult to influence global research priorities in its favor without a forum .
The continent lacks resources .
Sheni attended a four - day meeting to discuss global health at Arusha in northern Tanzania .
Sheni addressed more than 700 public health specialists from 100 countries .
Sheni told delegates at the Global Forum for Health Research 's annual meeting that less than 10 percent of the global health research budget of 70 billion dollars went to Africa .
Africa has 90 percent of the global diseases .
Sheni said the formation of the Asian and Pacific Health Research Forum and the Latin American Health Research Forum are steps in the right direction .
Global Forum for Health Research Chairman Richard Feachem said it was unfair for poor countries to be allocated meager sums of research funding .
Feachem said the majority of the poor are getting little health research funding compared to the wealthy few .
The Global Forum for Health Research is an independent , international foundation funded by the Rockefeller Foundation , the World Health Organization , the World Bank and the Governments of Canada , Denmark , Netherlands , Norway , Sweden and Switzerland .

New U.S. study claims that one - tenth of Internet 's sites are blocked by the Chinese Government authorities using updated Filtering technology .
A wide range of sites including a very high percentage of news sites and keywords were found to be blocked .
A U.S. study released on 03 December 2002 states that one - tenth of the Internet 's sites may be blocked by Chinese authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents , Taiwan , Tibet and other subjects .
The study was conducted by Harvard University 's berkman Center for Internet and society .
The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in China on at least 1 occasion .
Using a more narrow definition of blocked site the study concluded that 18931 websites were being blocked to Chinese web users .
Harvard researcher and co - author of the report Ben Edelman stated that it is likely that similar percentages apply to the Internet as a whole .
Edelman told AFP that it is highly likely that approximately one - tenth of the Internet is filtered by or recently has been filtered by China .
Edelman stated that there are many different ways to measure this effect and therefore hesitated to specify any single proportion .
The latest study was broader than prior surveys and gives perspective to disparate reports about websites that are filtered or blocked by China .
In the report it is concluded that --
China blocks a range of web content beyond that which is sexually explicit .
1000s of sites providing information about news , health , education , and entertainment were blocked .
Approximately 3284 sites from Taiwan were blocked .
The blocked sites also included those of U.S. news organizations including ABC News and CBS News , the Alta Vista search engine , and a number of U.S. universities .
The researchers found that 100 percent of the top 10 sites with keywords Tibet , Taiwan China , or equality were blocked .
A large number of other sites with keywords such as freedom , democracy and HIV were also blocked .
The BBC news site was consistently unavailable .
Sites for CNN , Time magazine , U.S. - based public broadcasting system , the Miami Herald , and the Philadelphia Inquirer were also often blocked .
The report found that 42 of google 's top 100 results for news were blocked .
Religious sites blocked in China included the Asian American Baptist Church , The atheist network , the Catholic Civil Rights League , Feng Shui , the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg , and the Denver Zen center .
China has an estimated 45 million Internet users .
China has been widely criticized in the West for blocking websites and for imprisoning people for viewing banned sites or using the Internet for anti - government activities .
The Chinese government is believed to routinely block a large number of foreign - based sites primarily those featuring dissident views or banned groups such as the Falungong spiritual organization but also certain foreign news sites and pages showing pornography .
A recent report by the U.S. - based Rand Corporation think tank found that the Chinese government now uses more technology to filter out objectionable content rather than relying solely on surveillance of users and seizure of equipment as it did in the past .
The rand report released earlier in 2002 found that Chinese authorities now appear to have more effective technology for filtering out undesirable content .

A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the UN 's nuclear agency could detect even infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq .
A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the UN 's nuclear agency could detect infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq .
David Donohue spoke at the IAEA laboratory in Seibersdorf on the southwest outskirts of Vienna .
Donohue said the equipment can detect particles down to the picogram ( a millionth of a millionth of a gram ) .
The first samples from Iraq are due to arrive to the laboratory this week .
IAEA and other UN inspectors have been taking soil , water and air samples since November 27 , 2001 at Iraqi sites suspected of being used for programs to make weapons of mass destruction .
Donohue said samples will be sent for corroboration to labs in France , the US , the UK ( Britain ) , Japan and Russia if IAEA finds any traces of radiation from enriched uranium or plutonium , or any chemical and biological agents .
Donohue said it is very difficult to manipulate radioactive isotopes without leaving a trail .
A trail will be left even if it 's only ultra - traces .
The IAEA is the UN agency charged with monitoring nuclear activity .
The UN Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission ( UNMOVIC ) tests for chemical , biological and ballistic missile programs .
UNMOVIC is based in New York .

South Korea urges North Korea to return nuclear reactor to UN surveillance .
North Korea had violated 1994 shut down by disabling surveillance devices .
20021222 South Korea urged North Korea to return the Yongbyon nuclear reactor to UN surveillance in order to deescalate the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .
20021221 the UN International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) stated that North Korea had disabled IAEA surveillance devices by breaking seals on IAEA equipment and blocking surveillance cameras at the country 's 5 megawatt nuclear reactor .
20021221 IAEA Director General General Mohammed ElBaradei expressed regret over North Korea 's actions .
A South Korean Foreign Ministry official stated --
The development is regrettable and will increase tension over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .
Japan and the United States should act jointly with South Korea .
The IAEA stated that ElBaradei warned the government of North Korea not to take further action that would prevent the IAEA from monitoring compliance with the 1994 accord with the United States shutting down the reactor .
20041212 North Korea stated that the country 's plutonium - producing nuclear program would recommence in order to produce energy due to a global embargo on oil shipments .
In 1994 the reactor was frozen under an accord in exchange for 500000 tons of fuel oil annually from the United States .
The accord additionally formed a consortium to build 2 light - water reactors .
International experts stated that the Yongbyon reactor was used to produce weapons - grade plutonium .
After the 1994 closing approximately 8000 spent fuel rods from the reactor were sealed in metal casings in cooling ponds .
20041000 the United States revealed that North Korea had admitted to implementing a nuclear program based on enriched uranium , a material for nuclear weapons .

North Korea removed UN seals at a laboratory suspected of being used to produce weapons - grade material .
This activity further escalates tension in the Korean Peninsula 's nuclear crisis and ignores international condemnation .
A source close to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said late on 021223 the North had started stripping the UN nuclear regulation group 's seals and monitoring equipment from the laboratory at Yongbyon .
The lab is suspected of having reprocessed fuel rods for weapons - grade plutonium before its activities were frozen under a 940000 arms control deal with the United Sates .
The source is fully informed of IAEA activities in North Korea and said the North Koreans are cutting the seals of the nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory and could complete it possibly by 021224 .
The move followed similar actions 021221-021222 at the Yongbyon nuclear facility during which the North Korean government took control of 1000s of spent fuel rods that could be used to make nuclear weapons .
The nuclear crisis dominated the first meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae - Jung and President - elect Roh Moo - hyun earlier 021223 .
Kim and Roh were meeting for the first time since Roh 's election last week and the meeting was supposed to focus on smoothing over the 030225 transfer of power between the outgoing and incoming leaders .
The 90 - minute talks instead centered on the North Korean government 's latest standoff with the international community .
President Kim 's spokeswoman Park Sun - sook said that Kim and Roh 's discussion was pinned down on international relations which focused on North Korea 's nuclear issue .
The South Korean government 's frustration with the North Korean government was evident in a foreign ministry statement which urged the North Korean government to restore the seals and disabled monitoring cameras on the rods .
The statement said that the North Korean government took further actions to unfreeze its nuclear activities despite repeated warnings from the South Korean government and the international community and was raising regional tension and amplifying international concerns over nuclear proliferation .
The United States responded to that development with swift condemnation .
US State Department spokesman Louis Fintor said the over 8000 spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they can be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons .
US Senator Richard Lugar said the North Korean government was creating a very dangerous situation , initially for South Korea and for Japan but ultimately for the United States .
Lugar will head the Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee in 030000 .
The United States has been stepping up international pressure on the North Korean government since 021222 .
Deputy US Ambassador Evans Revere met South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tai - sik in Seoul on 021223 to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the North Korean government following the US and South Korean foreign ministers ' urgent talks over the phone .
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi also expressed the widespread international alarm about the North Korean government 's regrettable latest move .
Analysts have said North Koreans could extract some 25 kilograms ( 55 pounds ) of weapons - grade plutonium for at least 3 nuclear weapons from the irradiated rods .
The North Korean government said it unfroze its nuclear facilities because it was in a desperate energy crisis aggravated by the suspension of fuel oil shipments .
The US government said the spent plutonium has nothing to do with power generation .
The United States and North Korea came close to war over the North Korean government 's plutonium program in the early 1990s .
The confrontation was defused when the US and North Korean Governments signed the 940000 agreed framework .
That accord has been undermined since the North Korean government admitted in 021000 to running a new , secret and separate program based on enriched uranium .
The US government cut its fuel aid to the North Korea in retaliation .

North Korea was criticized on December 26 , 2002 for moving to restart its long - dormant nuclear program .
The UN atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
North Korea was criticized on December 26 , 2002 for moving to restart its long - dormant nuclear program .
The UN atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung told officials that North Korea 's shifting of unspent fuel rods into a building housing a reactor capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium aggravated an already - tense situation .
Kim Dae Jung and officials assembled at an urgent national security meeting .
Kim Dae Jung said that North Korea moved to restart frozen nuclear facilities despite the international community 's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue .
This further aggravated the situation .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the shift of the rods was proactive .
Plutonium could be extracted for making nuclear warheads within months .
The United States dismissed the action as nuclear blackmail .
There was strong criticism from the United Nations ' International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Beginning last week IAEA saw its monitoring equipment disabled and seals removed from the nuclear facilities that had been dormant since a 1994 accord with the United States .
IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei dismissed claims by North Korea 's government that it was only acting in the wake of an energy crisis in North Korea .
ElBaradei said that the reprocessing facility at Yongbyong is irrelevant to North Korea 's ability to produce electricity .
North Korea has no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium given the status of its nuclear fuel cycle .
ElBaradei said restarting North Korea 's nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards and towards producing plutonium raises serious non - proliferation concerns is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .
The move of 1,000 unspent rods into the reactor building is the latest action taken by the energy - starved North since the apparent collapse of a 1994 accord that froze its nuclear capacity .
The move is confirmed by both the UN agency and the South Korean Foreign Ministry .
The facility has the capacity for 8,000 rods .
All have been stored in a cooling pond at Yongbyon since the United States offered North Korea annual supplies of heavy fuel oil and two new light water nuclear reactors in return for Pyongyang 's agreement to freeze its nuclear operations at Yongbyon .
The eight - year - old deal has fallen apart following US revelations in October 2002 that North Korea had admitted to running a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology in violation of the accord .
North Korea is bankrupt and on the brink of economic collapse .
It has been pushing for negotiations with the United States .
Experts say North Korea needs aid and security guarantees from the United States to ensure its survival .
Throughout the nuclear dispute North Korea has said it is ready to sit down and talk with the United States and even to refreeze its Yongbyon program .
President Kim has been pushing the United States to accept the offer under Kim 's sunshine policy of engagement with the North .
President Kim has criticized the United States for previously sidelining South Korea in handling North Korea and said South Korea should take a leading role .
Kim was critical of the US handling of the stand - off when eight years ago the United States and North Korea drew back from the brink of war over Pyongyang 's plutonium program .
The President has complained that South Korea was sidelined during the entire dispute and ended up paying a multi - billion dollar bill for the light - water reactors .
Kim 's chief security adviser Yim Sung - joon said the President instructed that North Korea should take lead because the North Korean nuclear issue is important to the Korean peninsula .
This was said in a statement after December 26 , 2002 's meeting .
The United States said it would stand up to nuclear blackmail and has ruled out negotiations .
The US pledged not to reward bad behavior .
Experts have joined the IAEA in dismissing the idea that North Korea was relaunching the reactor for energy purposes .
Director General for International institutions at the ministry in Seoul Chun Young - Woo said it would produce at its peak enough for one large office building which is a negligible amount .

Experts warn that North Korea could produce weapons - grade plutonium from spent fuel rods at re - opened nuclear reactor .
Existing rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months .
Experts stated that 8000 spent fuel rods reportedly stockpiled by North Korea at a nuclear reactor the country is threatening to re - start could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons .
Experts stated that the rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months .
The IAEA stated that North Korea additionally moved 1000 fresh rods into the nuclear reactor as well .
The reactor could produce enough spent rods to construct 1 atomic bomb per year if reactivated .
The experimental nuclear plant in Yongbyon is a miniature of electricity - producing nuclear plants in Western countries but operates on the same principles .
The Yongbyon plant produces 5 megawatts .
Plants in France produce 1300 megawatts .
The Yongbyon plant is 100 km north of the North Korean capital Pyongyang .
Nuclear reactor process --
4 meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split , releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms , creating more neutrons in a chain reaction .
Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity .
Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3-4 years .
Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide .
The recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons .
Nuclear experts stated that to make weapons , a high proportion of plutonium 239 ( military grade plutonium , as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants ) must be extracted .

British officials are deeply concerned by a warning from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concerning North Korea 's opening of the Yongbyon facility and possible nuclear intentions .
A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said Thursday that the UK government is deeply concerned about the latest revelations in a warning by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concerning North Korea 's possible nuclear intentions .
The comments came after the IAEA accused the North Korean government of nuclear brinkmanship and said the North Korean government had begun work to reactivate the Yongbyon reactor in breach of a 940000 agreement with the United States Government .
The UK Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the UK government is in regular contact with international partners about the implications of the latest developments and is committed to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wherever it may occur .
The spokeswoman added that the North Korean government must comply with international obligations and eliminate nuclear weapons .
The IAEA has said the North Korean government had no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium that could be produced at the newly reopened Yongbyon site that is capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium .
The IAEA said the North Koreans had moved 1000 fresh fuel rods into the Yongbyon reactor building .
Of more concern are the 8000 spent fuel rods at the facility they started unsealing 021215-021221 and the dismantling of IAEA monitoring equipment at the site .
Experts say the spent rods could be used to build 3-6 atomic bombs within 6-8 months .
The United States Government offered supplies of fuel oil and 2 new light water nuclear reactors in return for the North Korean government 's agreement to freeze nuclear operations under the 940000 agreed framework shutting down Yongbyon .
The agreement fell apart following US government revelations in 021000 that the North Korean government had admitted to a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology .
The US government suspended oil shipments to North Korea as punishment .
The North Korean government in turn claimed to be in desperate need of power generation after the oil supplies were cut and began during 021215-021221 to unseal the spent fuel rods at the facility and to dismantle monitoring equipment .

South Korea threatens to cease support following North Korean nuclear re - activation .
President - elect Roh seeks peaceful solution .
20021227 South Korean President - elect Roh Moo - hun stated --
South Korea will cease support if North Korea continues to ignore global concern over the country 's nuclear weapons program .
North Korea should not act further to aggravate the situation .
Inter - Korean exchanges will suffer if tensions among South Koreans escalate due to the actions of North Korea .
South Korea must take initiative in coping with the crisis because the issue directly concerns the Korean people 's survival .
Roh campaigned on a pro - engagement platform and has endorsed President Kim Dae - jung 's softline sunshine policy of engagement with North Korea .
An aide stated that Roh 's incoming Administration has established channels of communication with the North to defuse the crisis and discover North Korea 's intentions .
The US supports the initiative .
Roh takes office in 20030200 .
North Korea is re - activating nuclear operations at Yongbyon after violating a 1994 arms control deal with the United States .
The IAEA stated that North Korea has cut seals and impeded surveillance equipment at 3 facilities at Yongbyon .
Yongbyon is 100 km north of Pyongyang .
The United States urged North Korea to meet obligations under international arms control accords .
US State Department spokeswoman Brenda Greenberg stated that attempts to restarts facilities would compound North Korea 's violations of these international commitments .
20030110 President George W. Bush is to send an envoy to Seoul do discuss defusing the crisis with Roh .
Roh will subsequently send an envoy to Washington .
Roh has advocated a peaceful resolution to the crisis through dialogue and has criticized the US hardline policy as potentially dangerous .
20021226 incoming Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Republican Senator Richard Lugar stated on NBC television that a US attack would be inadvisable because North Korea would likely retaliate with a potentially devastating attack on the Seoul area .
Roh 's aide acknowledged Lugar 's statement .
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer stated that Australia will suspend plans to open an embassy in Pyongyang to avoid appearing to condone North Korea 's nuclear actions .
20021226 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei stated --
North Korea has moved 1,000 fresh fuel rods into the reactor building at Yongbyon -- which is capable of producing military plutonium -- as a prelude to reactivation .
North Korea has no use for plutonium in its civilian program and thus may be planning military activity .
The IAEA 's board of governors will shortly issue a report on the recent developments .
The Board was originally scheduled to meet 20030106 .

China launches unmanned space craft Shenzhou IV into a preset orbit with the eventual goal of sending astronauts into space .
30 December 2002 at 00:40 am -- China launched space craft Shenzhou IV into a preset orbit .
Shenzhou IV was launched by a Long March II F carrier rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern Gansu province .
Chinese scientists announced Shenzhou IV would conduct experiments on the astronaut flight system and control of Shenzhou IV 's environment and life support system .
A Chinese aerospace official announced Shenzhou IV would return to Inner Mongolia within 7 days .
According to the Xinhua news agency the leading designer of the astronaut system for China 's manned space program commander Su Shuangning stated --
China will soon send astronauts to space .
Shenzhou IV is equipped to carry astronauts .
Chinese astronauts must first receive training in basic theories , professional skills and flight procedures and tasks .
In July 2002 the Pentagon announced --
China could send astronauts into space in 2003 .
China plans to build a reusable space vehicle similar to the US space shuttle .
14 Chinese astronauts have undergone training on Shenzhou space craft .
The Chinese astronauts were selected from thousands of air force pilots .
In 2001 Russia signed a 5 - year space cooperation agreement with China .
The agreement stipulates that Russia provide China with manned space craft technologies and train Chinese astronauts in Russian facilities .
In May 2002 official Chinese media announced that China plans to establish a base on the moon to exploit the Moon 's mineral resources .
Space expert at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris Laurence nardon stated --
US should not view China 's space manned program as a security threat .
China is a member of the ballistic missile club .
China 's space program is less of a world threat than India 's or Israel 's .
Some US researchers believe China is developing weaponization of its space technology .
China may be developing weaponization of its space technology but is not currently able to implement it .
China plans to put humans in space for prestige .
In November 2002 Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. President Zhang Qingwei stated --
Shenzhou III 's carrier rocket was equipped with a fault - detecting and handling system .
Shenzhou IV is backed by a ground - based search and rescue system and reinforced by other more reliable safety measures than Shenzhou III 's .
Designer of China 's spacecraft system Qi Faren announced --
The functions , indices and data relevant to manned flights tested well on three previous successful launches and landings of Shenzhou spaceships between 1999 and March 2002 .
China established a space program in 1992 .
Shenzhou I launched in November 1999 and returned to earth within one day .
10 January 2001 -- Shenzhou II launched .
Western analysts suspect re - entry failed .
25 March 2002 -- Shenzhou III launched .
The re - entry vehicle successfully returned to Inner Mongolia a week later .
Only the US and former USSR have sent humans into space .
Shenzhou IV is also referred to as Divine Vessel IV .

European Space Agency is finalizing deal with Russian government to allow for Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , in French Guiana replacing phased - out Ariane - 4 launchers .
Plans for Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since costly modifications to launch facilities must be made to accommodate the Russian rocket .
The European Space Agency ( ESA ) stated 10 January 2003 that it was finalizing a deal with the Russian government that could allow Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , French Guiana .
The deal between the ESA and the Russian Government could be written as early as March 2003 and signed by the Russian government in April 2003 .
The deal would allow for Soyuz missiles to help replace phased - out Ariane - 4 launchers .
Ariane - 4 launchers send payloads up to 2.8 tons into geostationary orbit .
Spacecraft launched from Kourou benefit from the Earth 's full rotational speed on the equator to aid their trajectory into space .
With this extra momentum , the spacecraft require less fuel .
Plans for the Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since modifications to be made to launch facilities in order to accommodate the Russian rocket are predicted to cost between 250 and 300 million euro .
The Russian space program has experienced funding problems and was unwilling to contribute one third of the bill as ESA had requested .
In November 2002 the Government of France proposed to fund the Russian Government 's share with a loan to be paid back by profits from the launches .
The ESA stated that no financial divisions have been decided yet .
France joined Russia in creating a joint company Starsem in 1996 to commercialize and market the Soyuz launches from Russia 's Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan .
Soyuz missiles used to send satellites and cosmonauts into space are the most used type of spacecraft .
Soyuz missiles have over 1700 launches since first launching the Sputnik satellite into orbit in 1957 .

Japan demands that North Korea annul the 20030110 decision to withdraw from the nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Japan will collaborate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and countries including Russia to ensure North Korea 's reversal .
Koizumi condemns and is concerned by North Korea 's decision .
20030110 Koizumi held a day - long summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Koizumi stated that Koizumi and Putin held identical views on the North Korean crisis .
Late 20030110 a Japanese spokesman stated to Interfax news that Koizumi encouraged Putin to employ the Russian government 's influence on North Korean leadership in pursuing a reversal .
Putin consented to Koizumi 's request and stated that dialogue with North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il was possible .
Koizumi stated that Russia , Japan , and the international community would benefit from improved bilateral relations if Russia and Japan could overcome previous disputes .
In 1945 the Soviet Union seized 4 Southern Kuril Islands still claimed by Japan .
Koizumi stated --
Japan will continue to assist Russia in dismantling weapons of mass destruction including decommissioned nuclear submarines for which Japan will allocate over 200 million dollars .
The weapons should be neutralized immediately in the interest of global security .
Japan will contribute 100 million dollars to the processing of weapons - grade plutonium to prevent appropriation by terrorists .
Japan has contributed 56 million dollars to scientific projects and will continue to cooperate with Russia .
Russia has previously refused to pressure North Korea over defense policy .
Analysts believe that Russia has limited authority to do so .
Koizumi visited the grave of Japanese World War II prisoners in a cemetery at the donskoi monastery in Moscow .
Koizumi will visit the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk late 20030111 and return to Tokyo 20030112 .

An Indian information technology expert disproved the phobia of cyber attacks and said the threat was overstated .
Director of the Indian Institute of Information Technology S. Sadagopan said the cyber attack is similar to the Y 2K myth ; although these things could happen , they will not happen .
Y 2K was a computer malfunction expected to occur when 1999 changed to 2000 but it did not inflict widespread damage .
Sadagopan addressed delegates at a conference on information security .
Sadagopan stated that these things happen with all technology if history is reviewed and that imaginative people can cause extraordinary problems even with primitive technology .
Sadagopan said the G 8 nations have lost 43 billion dollars due to cyber crime .
The G 8 nations are comprised of France , Britain , Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia and the United States .
Sadagopan said most people have an alarmist view of such attacks .
The attacks range from viruses , flame - mail ( abusive e-mail ) , stone throwing ( disfiguring a home page ) to cyber squatters and scripts for breaking into Internet sites .
Sadagopan stated that many sensitive installations such as nuclear and power plants , and missiles have an Internet protocol address and that once someone hacks into the sites one can trip the power lines or lead planes and missiles to their choice destinations .
Sadagopan added that this type of hacking is possible , but there is no need to panic .
Sadagopan said it needs to be recognized and while we should be sensitive about such threats it should not be sensationalized rather a pragmatic approach should be taken .
The U.S. State Department said in May 2002 that a computer Hacker had infiltrated its e-mail system .
The Hacker sent a potentially damaging virus to more than 20000 people who receive travel warnings electronically .
A 50 - line code of the love bug virus affects more than 2.8 million files monthly .
Hackers have sent love letter e-mail to all chosen Heads of States from adolfahitler.com .
Pentagon sites had denial of service for more than three hours .
India 's premier nuclear research center Bhabha Atomic resarch center sites were disfigured .
Sadagopan stated that a section of technologists think cyber soldiers , cyber policemen and cyber insurance is needed .
Sadagopan said the threat is overstated and that it is like any other threat , like a foreigner driving on Bangalore roads .
The threat needs to be accepted and then education is the next step .
Sadagopan said it needs to be started today .
It can not be postponed .

Pakistan authorities announce upgrades of security of nuclear facilities and employees after press reports alleging leaks of its its nuclear technology .
Pakistan on 030122 announced upgrades to the security of nuclear facilities and employees after a series of press reports alleging leaks of nuclear technology to North Korea and possibly Iran and Iraq .
The Los Angeles Times , New York Times and Japanese media have carried several reports quoting unnamed US officials saying that Pakistani scientists or military officers had sold the North Korean government uranium - enrichment technology for the nuclear program .
Pakistan 's government has angrily rejected the reports as malicious and insisted that nuclear technology had never been sold or leaked .
The military statement said Pakistan 's has a long - standing capability for achieving the highest levels of safety and security which is adequate and fail - safe .
The Pakistani government 's announcement came after President Pervez Musharraf chaired a meeting of the Development Control Committee of the National Command Authority ( NCA ) to review security of Pakistan 's nuclear program .
An official military statement said the physical protection and custodial controls at Pakistan 's nuclear sites and facilities has been recently upgraded .
The statement said the NCA gave approval for further tightening of different defensive layers and enhancing physical security as well as ensuring the effectiveness of watertight safety of materials , equipment and technology .
The NCA also adopted steps to improve personal reliability programs for people working in nuclear - related programs .
Scientists , engineers and military officers working in nuclear programs are routinely screened every 2 years according to a survey of Pakistan 's nuclear security by Italy 's arms control institution the Landau network .
2 Pakistani nuclear scientists were arrested 12 months ago and interrogated by US Federal Bureau of Investigation agents on suspicion of possible cooperation with the Taliban .
These arrests underlined fears that nuclear technology could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists .
Pakistan 's government has been developing a nuclear program to match arch - rival India 's since the 1970s and only went public with the program in 980500 when testing 5 nuclear devices .
Jane 's Defence Weekly estimates that Pakistan 's government possesses 25-50 nuclear warheads and has a uranium enrichment plant and plutonium reprocessing plant close to the capital Islamabad and at least 4 nuclear reactors across the country .
Pakistan 's NCA also decided on 030122 not to respond to India 's 3 missile tests this month and stated that Pakistan 's government has no desire to increase tension in the region .

Plutonium enough to produce 25 nuclear bombs which has gone unaccounted for at a Japanese nuclear facility is mostly due to measuring shortcomings and miscalculations .
A nuclear fuel reprocessing plant about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) north of Tokyo in Tokaimura has extracted 6890 kilograms ( 15158 pounds or 7.6 short tons ) of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel since it began operating in 770000 .
A Japanese education and science ministry official said on 030128 that the total currently accounted for at the facility was 206 kg short of the plutonium initially estimated to have been produced by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from power plants .
It is known to take 5-8 kg of plutonium to produce a nuclear bomb .
The official at the ministry 's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) of the United Nations .
The finding was also reported to the Japanese government 's Atomic Energy Commission on 030128 .
The education and scienc Ministry denied the possibility that any plutonium had been illegally removed from the facility .
The official said 94 kg of the missing plutonium is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without being measured .
The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element .
The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of .
The official also pointed to possible errors in the estimate of plutonium extracted in the process .
The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium .
The report was based on inspections at the Tokaimura facility done under IAEA safeguard rules designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear materials for production of nuclear weapons .
Tokaimura is a Pacific Coast complex of nuclear - related facilities and made headlines in 990000 when the world 's worst nuclear plant accident since Chernobyl in 860000 occurred at a uranium reprocessing plant there .
3 workers set off a critical reaction in 990000 when they poured too much uranium into a precipitation tank .
2 of the 3 workers later died .
Safety concerns at nuclear facilities in Japan were further highlighted on 030127 when a High Court upheld the suspension of operations of a troubled experimental fast - breeder reactor which has been shut since an accident in 950000 .

Officials stated that on 030128 Italy 's Internet network was hit by most serious Internet attack to date that severely disrupted Italy 's post offices .
The attack on Italy 's Internet network occurred as similiar attacks around the globe appeared to be subsiding .
A computer security expert named Fulvio berghella stated that the 030128 attack on Italy 's Internet network were the result of a digital worm named sq hell and that the attack was the worst Internet attack ever to hit Italy .
Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell was particularly virulent and replicated itself at the rate of 8000 times an hour .
Fulvio berghella heads an Internet security firm named securitynet .
Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell has a very high capacity to replicate itself and the digital worm named sq Hell is slowing down the Poste italiane computer network and making some computers inoperable .
The sq Hell is considered a computer worm .
A computer worm is unlike a computer virus and does not require a user to open an e-mail attachment or initiate any other type of command to infect the computer .
Paolo baldelli stated that online work at Italy 's 14000 post offices was severely disrupted by the Internet attack .

Indian Deputy PM identifies Southeast Asia as a new center for jihadi terrorism and urges closer international counter - terrorism cooperation following bombing in Bali .
20030204 Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani stated at a public lecture in Singapore addressing academics , diplomats and business executives that Southeast Asia was becoming an operational center of terrorism and Governments must cooperate more closely to combat terrorism .
20021012 terrorists executing a bombing attack on the Indonesian resort island of Bali .
Indonesian authorities stated that the Islamic militant group Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible .
The attack is considered part of a global incitement to Jihad by al-Qaeda and its allies .
Advani stated --
The Bali attack established Southeast Asia as a potential new theater for the spread of jihadi extremism .
India previously knew that the operational center of jihadi terrorism is located near India due to the US - lead bombing campaign against extremist bases in Afghanistan .
Advani stated --
The menace of religious extremism has inspired international terrorism .
Terrorism should not be identified with any religion but jihadi terrorism has spread more global violence than any other extremist doctrine .
Advani stated --
Countries must continue in pursuing enhanced cooperation including intelligence sharing and border controls to combat the problem perpetrated by global terrorism and its concomitants -- drug trafficking , illegal arms trade and cross - border crime .
While the international consensus is that terrorism can not be tolerated , the instruments the international community proposes to deal with terrorism do not meet the requirements of the problem .
Advani stated at a forum organized by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies --
Countries must formulate and implement an integrated and cooperative approach to security by designing new security systems to protecting transport , communication and energy infrastructure from terrorist attack as well as obstructing terrorists ' funding .
Unilateral military action such as the standoff between the US and Iraq on disarming Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatens peace and could lead to unforeseen negative consequences .
The issue of weapons of mass destruction should be dealt with in the UN .
Rising tensions in the Middle East will affect oil prices .
The the region should provide greater energy security through developing alternative energy technologies .
Advani visited Singapore 20030202-20030205 .

A team of South African weapons experts departs for Iraq with UN approval to assist with Iraq 's disarmament program .
Political tensions are increasing as the U.S. threatens war against Iraq .
South African President Thabo Mbeki stated on 18 February 2003 that a South African team of weapons experts will depart to Iraq within days to assist with Iraq 's disarmament program .
In an address to parliament in Cape Town Mbeki stated --
A number of distinguished South Africans will travel to Iraq this week .
The weapons experts will be able to address all matters that relate to nuclear , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction , missile systems , non - proliferation and disarmament .
Mbeki stated in his State of the Nation Address on 14 February 2003 that Iraq had accepted an offer from South Africa to send a team of weapons experts to assist Iraqi government officials , scientists and engineers with its disarmament program .
South Africa dismantled a number of nuclear weapons 10 years ago and was recently praised for its model cooperation with weapons experts invited to inspect its sites .
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad stated that South Africa is the only country in the world that has destroyed nuclear weapons .
Pahad stated that the group of South African experts will be able to assist the Iraqis by relating its experience .
The team of seven experts comprises Deon Smit , Ben Steyn , Phillip Coleman , super moloi , Daan van beeck , Peter Goosen and Tom Markram .
The team would visit Iraq in a consulting role and would not replace UN weapons inspectors .
Ben Steyn is a colonel in the South African National Defense Force .
Steyn oversaw the end of the apartheid regime 's chemical and biological warfare program called Project Coast .
Germ warfare expert Wouter Basson directed Project Coast before Steyn .
In 2002 Basson was acquitted in a South African court on all 46 charges filed against him including murder , fraud and drug dealing .
Basson 's trial related to his work as head of Project Coast .
Basson 's trial lasted 30 months .
Smit is a South African parastatal Armscor 's acquisitions general manager .
Coleman is the Managing Director of South Africa 's designated single small - scale facility in terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention .
Van beek is the director of non - proliferation and space in the Trade and Industry Department .
Van beek also heads the secretariat for the Council for the non - proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which oversees South Africa 's non - proliferation legislation .
Mbeki expressed confidence that the South African team of experts would contribute greatly to Iraq 's efforts to meet obligations imposed by the UN Security Council .
The Government of South Africa 's proposal to assist the Iraqi government was discussed with UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan and the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq .
This week the UN Security Council is debating U.S. threats to lead a war on Iraq after chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix delivered a progress report to the body on 14 February 2003 .
South Africa 's ambassador to the United Nations Dumisani Khumalo has been calling for public sessions of the Security Council instead of closed meetings in order to allow other countries to participate in discussions .
South Africa is the chair of both the African Union and Non - Aligned Movement and has been vocal in its opposition to an attack on Iraq .
South Africa states that the UN Security Council is the only body fit to deal with the matter .
In February 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former President Nelson Mandela stated that U.S. President George W. Bush lacked foresight , could not think properly , and would cause a world holocaust if the U.S. continued with plans to wage war against Iraq .
Critics have stated that despite the dire effects an Iraqi conflict would have on the African continent South Africa needed to carefully assess balancing its economic relations with the United States with its serious opposition to a U.S. - led war .
In his speech before parliament 14 February 2003 Mbeki referred to this criticism as most unfortunate stating --
Critics suggest that the South African Government 's behavior with regard to the United States Government should be governed by economic benefits that derive from AGOA ( African Growth and Opportunity Act ) .
The South African government maintains very good relations with the United States Government .
Differences on any issue have never pressured the South African Government into submitting to the United States ' views .

Iranian opposition group accused Iran of building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program with goal of altering power balance in region .
UN nuclear inspectors to depart for Iran to conduct inspections of 2 sites .
On 20 February 2003 Iranian opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) stated that Iran was building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program .
The statement was made on the evening preceding a UN team 's departure for Iran to conduct inspections at 2 nuclear sites .
U.S. Representative for NCRI soona samsami stated at a press conference in Washington D.C. that Iran 's strategy is to build weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons in particular in order to alter the balance of power in the region in its favor and to facilitate export of fundamentalism and terrorism .
UN International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and its director Mohamed ElBaradei depart for Iran 21 February 2003 to conduct an inspection at a site in Natanz where representatives of the NCRI have stated that the regime has concealed a test centrifuge .
NCRI showed satellite photographs of a site in Natanz portraying a cluster of warehouses in which the group claims the regime has hidden centrifuges used to enrich uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons .
Samsami stated that the clerical regime is taking advantage of the current crisis in the region and has accelerated its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons .
On 09 February 2003 Iranian President Mohammed Khatami recognized the existence of a uranium mine and extraction center but promised that the uranium would be used only for peaceful purposes .
The U.S. government was skeptical of Iran 's intentions and stated that Iran 's pursuit of a complete fuel cycle only made sense if it were pursuing nuclear weapons .
NCRI stated on 20 February 2003 that Iran 's clerical rulers are also building and have tested missiles that would eventually have a range of 4000 to 6000 kilometers ( 2500 to 3700 miles ) .
NCRI stated that the information on Iran 's weapons program had been supplied through their intelligence network within Iran and that satellite photographs were supplied by the Institute for Science and International Security .
The Institute for Science and International Security is a non - profit clearinghouse for security information and images .
Samsami stated --
The Iranian government had removed sensitive equipment from the Natanz site in anticipation of the IAEA inspection this weekend .
The Iranian government intended to bar IAEA entry to 1 of the 5 large buildings where the centrifuge is located and would claim that it is a warehouse similar to the other 4 .
Samsami provided street addresses of the suspect facilities .
ElBaradei planned to conduct inspections at the Natanz facility south of Tehran and at the Arak site southwest of Tehran on 22 February 2003 and 23 February 2003 .
NCRI stated that the Arak site produces heavy water for the production of plutonium .
Plutonium is used as a trigger in nuclear weapons .
Samsami stated that such weapons are a matter of survival for the regime in Iran .
Samsami stated that Iran 's clerical regime is in a tenuous position facing unprecedented social disenchantment and expansion of popular resistance and would therefore not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction to stabilize its position .
The Government of Iran revealed earlier this month that it had discovered uranium deposits near the central city of Yazd and that a uranium oxide plant had been completed in the central city of Isfahan and would be complemented by an enrichment plant now under construction near Kashan to its north .
The plant in Yazd Province would produce concentrated yellow cake uranium while another facility at an undisclosed location would complete the cycle by producing finished fuel made entirely in Iran .

Kashmiri militant groups claim responsibility for attack on Indian police post in the disputed region that killed at least 11 people .
Indian officials claim that foreign infiltrators from Pakistan executed the attack but local Kashmiri groups call this baseless propaganda .
On 16 March 2003 Kashmiri militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of Kashmir in India stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by Indian troops .
The Hizbul Mujahideen is the largest group fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region .
A spokesman for Hizbul Mujahideen who declined to be identified stated to AFP --
The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander Amanullah and 3 other fighters of Hizbul Mujahideen by the Indian army in Kashmir .
Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from Hizbul Mujahideen , Harkatul Mujahideen , Harkatul Jihad - e - Islami and Al Badar attacked the camp before midnight on 15 March 2003 and into 16 March 2003 and killed at least 12 soldiers .
All the fighters who participated in the operation were local Kashmiris not infiltrators from Pakistan as claimed by Indian officials .
The Indian claim that cross - border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied Kashmir .
The militants attacked the post in Gool in the Udhampur district approximately 95 miles north of Indian Kashmir 's winter capital Jammu .
At least 11 people were killed in the attack .
A spokesman for another Kashmiri separatist group called Harkatul Mujahideen agreed with the Hizbul official stating --
The attack was executed by local Kashmiri fighters affiliated with 4 groups .
If India blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community .
The Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan and is claimed by both .
India and Pakistan have fought 2 wars over Kashmir since each gained independence from Britain in 1947 .
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training rebels fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir .
Pakistan denies the charge .
Since 1989 more than 37500 people have died in the insurgency in Kashmir .

Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast .
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation .
On March 21 , 2003 a spokesman for the Central Asian country 's defense ministry said Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast .
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation .
Defense ministry spokesman abish smailov told AFP that incidents occur when powerful weapons such as Scud missiles are used .
Smailov said that Kazakh air space is controlled at all times using measures involving anti - missile defenses , fighter jets and anti - terrorist units .
Kazakhstan 's increased air defenses come during Kazakhstan 's air force carries out exercises along its Caspian shores .
The shores are a center of Kazakhstan 's nascent oil industry .
Western countries said it is inadequately defended in the event of terrorist attack .
Ex - Soviet Kazakhstan is separated from Iraq by a 600 - kilometer ( 360 - mile ) section of the Caspian Sea and Iranian territory .
Kazakhstan is currently cooperating with the United States on strengthening defenses in this oil - rich area .
Kazakh politicians said that any overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein could reduce Western interests in exploiting Kazakhstan 's oil fields .
Investors could turn their attention to Iraq 's vast oil resources instead .

Several million Thai people use the drug .
The methamphetamine pills known as Yaa BAA have surpassed heroin as Thailand 's number one killer drug .
Several million Thai people use the drug .
The pill has become part of Thai society .
No other drug has become as integral in decades .
The effects on the brains of its consumers is disastrous .
Yaa BAA is known as crazy medicine in Thailand .
It has been targeted in a two - month anti - drugs crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,900 suspected traffickers .
There is much concern over the drug .
The drug 's popularity increased in the mid - 1990s .
It has made Thailand the world 's number one consumer .
Pierre - Arnaud chouvy and Joel meissonnier state in their book Yaa BAA recently published by the Institute of Research on contemporary Southeast Asia that the psychotropic drugs is used across society for both work and pleasure .
Construction workers , sailors , farmers and taxi drivers take the drug to help them through long working days .
Students use it to get through exam periods .
Clubbers use it to help them dance all night .
Yaa BAA possesses several qualities that have helped it supplant heroin as the drug of choice in Thailand .
The book states that the drug conveys a completely positive image .
It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic .
The energy , confidence and euphoric feeling has given users an image as a drug of happiness .
The pills can also be easily consumed .
They can be popped or dissolved in a glass of water , taken intravenously , pulverized and inhaled , or smoked .
There are at least 90 types of the pill .
Yaa BAA is easy to manufacture and do not have any climate uncertainties like other drugs have .
Instructions on how to manufacture the drug are available on the Internet .
Heroin requires opium poppy as its raw ingredient and cocaine depends on yields from the coca plant .
The drug has an affordable price .
It cost 60 baht ( 1.50 dollars ) per pill on the streets before Thailand 's drug war started on February 1 , 2003 and push the price up 300 percent .
The pill costs five - cents to produce .
800 million pills entered Thailand from Myanmar last year .
The book states that the majority of the drug comes from Myanmar particularly the areas controlled by the Wa of the UWSA ( United Wa State Army ) .
The book is referring to the pro - Yangon ethnic group said to operate around 50 laboratories close to the border and the mobile production units .
Myanmar could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the UWSA , and the jungle canopy where UWSA operate .
The military and UWSA links result in a lack of law enforcement .
The drug has become a specialty of the Golden Triangle where Thailand , Laos and Myanmar converge .
Much of the world 's opium is still produced there .
Chouvy and meissonnier say that methamphetamine is overtaking heroin as the production drug of choice in the area and is profiting enormously from the distribution networks that heroin trafficking has already established .
Five percent of Thailand 's population is now estimated to abuse methamphetamine .
The International Narcotics Control Bureau says the figure makes it the largest per capita consumer in the world .
The drug has been around in other forms for years .
It was first used in the 1920s as an antidepressant and then as a psychostimulant during World War II and the Vietnam War .
People recruited from impoverished ethnic minorities transport the pills along a multitude of routes .
Myanmar soldiers and Thai police and bureaucrats protect the cargo and allow them to eventually reach consumers in Thailand .
The books states that one pill will pass through seven intermediaries from the frontier runner to the retailer .
The retailer will usually sell more to the drug user than he or she requires .
This creates another dealer and explains the drug 's easy availability across Thailand .
Owners of boats in the southern coastal province of Ranong and construction foremen in Bangkok are known to force their workers to take the drug at the beginning of the workday .
Occasionally in rural areas the farmers dissolve the drug in a bottle which they drink while working .
Consumers are as young as seven and school has become one of the main hubs for trafficking of methamphetamine .
Thailand 's youth are the most at risk .

Afghanistan 's Interior Minister states that Taliban is not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite post - winter increase in attacks on government and foreign targets in the country .
Most of the attacks are carried out by Pakistan - based former Taliban members sent into Afghanistan and funded by drug smuggling operations or supporters in Pakistan .
On 03 April 2003 Afghanistan 's Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali stated that Taliban and remaining al-Qaeda militants are not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite their increased attacks on government and foreign targets .
Jalali was speaking at his first press conference since taking office in February 2003 .
Jalali stated that the arrival of spring weather was the reason for the increased number of attacks by Taliban and remaining members of Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network .
The traditional fighting season in Afghanistan is spring after the harsh winters .
Jalali stated that due to the warmer spring weather terrorist activities have increased particularly in the south and southeast regions of Afghanistan .
On 02 April 2003 the U.S. State Department stated that security in Afghanistan was volatile and unpredictable following a series of attacks against foreigners .
In a travel advisory the U.S. State Department stated that travel in all areas of Afghanistan including the capital Kabul is unsafe due to military operations , land mines , banditry , armed rivalry among political and tribal groups , and the possibility of terrorist attacks including attacks using vehicular or other bombs .
Taliban and al-Qaeda militants regularly launch attacks on government and foreign targets .
Last week a foreign Red Cross worker was murdered and 2 U.S. special forces were killed in an ambush while on patrol .
Jalali stated --
On 03 April 2003 Afghan militia forces were fighting Taliban extremists for the 3rd day near Spin Boldak in southern Kandahar province near the Pakistani border .
There are approximately 50-60 terrorists in the mountains of the southern Kandahar province and the Kandahar security forces are conducting operations against them .
On 02 April 2003 2 members of the security forces were killed and 1 was wounded .
7 of the terrorists were arrested .
Several former Taliban members were arrested in another operation in southern Ghazni province .
Jalali stated that among the former Taliban members arrested were several well - known former Taliban figures who were in Afghanistan to establish a network of terrorist organizations and to conduct anti - government activities in the area .
Among those arrested was former Taliban Education Minister Shaheed Kheil .
Jalali stated --
Approximately 15 suspected Taliban members were captured in Kandahar and 9 killed in operations launched after the 27 March 2003 murder of the Red Cross worker .
Most of the terrorist attacks are carried out by former Taliban members based across the border in Pakistan .
These members have confessed that they were sent from Pakistan into Afghanistan by the former Taliban leader .
The Pakistan - based former Taliban members conducting the attacks were being funded by former drug smuggling operations or by supporters in Pakistan .
The militants coming across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan are organized by former Taliban elements .
Funds are transferred to the Pakistan - based former Taliban members from Karachi , Quetta and Peshawar but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting the former Taliban .
It is true that the interrogated Afghan Taliban stated that they had come from Pakistan and received their financial support from Karachi and Quetta but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting them .
There are many fundamentalists across the world as well as in Pakistan and Afghanistan .

A purported Ayman al-Zawahiri recording called for more suicide attacks , highlighting again the role of Egyptians in al-Qaeda , while suspicions grow that another Egyptian , Seif al-Adel , may have been behind the bombings in Saudi Arabia .
In a message aired 030521 by Arabic Qatar 's Al-Jazeera satellite channel , the purported voice of Ayman al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to force Westerners out of Muslim lands by attacking westerners and emulating the 010911 suicide attacks in the United States .
The speaker called for Muslims to muster their resolve and hit the embassies of America , England , Australia and Norway , and strike at the interests , companies and employees of America , England , Australia and Norway .
The speaker urged Muslims to attack and eject Americans , British , Australians and Norwegians out of Muslim homelands .
The speaker told Muslims not to allow Americans , British , Australians , Norwegians or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of Muslim countries .
Egyptian experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of Zawahiri 's voice and proved Zawahiri was alive and still as influential as before in al-Qaeda .
Montasser al-Zayat , a lawyer who has represented Islamic militant suspects in Egypt , stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of Zawahiri , Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 's top lieutenant .
Al-Zayat stated that the recording was Zawahiri 's voice , style and manner .
Dia al-Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was Zawahiri 's and that the message bore Zawahiri 's characteristic emphasis on Islamic militant attacks against Arab governments which are allied to the United States .
Al-Rashwan is a journalist with Egypt 's government daily Al-Ahram and an expert on Islamic militants .
According to Rashwan , while bin Laden has always stressed international targets , Zawahiri has gradually shown increasing support for Arab targets as well .
Rashwan thought it was clear that Zawahiri is still second in command of al-Qaeda and that his stress on local ( Arab ) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by Al-Qaeda itself but also groups inspired by them .
Montasser al-Zayat said that he believed bin Laden was under secure protection with Zawahiri .
Zayat thought that security conditions sometimes dictate which one speaks out .
The situations and locations of Zawahiri , bin Laden and other top al-Qaeda members have been unknown since the United States struck the bases of al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan in 011000 .
Rashwan was unable to illuminate suspicions that Seif al-Adel , another Egyptian , might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people , including 9 bombers , in Riyadh , Suadi Arabia 030512 .
Rashwan and other Egyptian experts said that Adel has become Al-Qaeda 's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding Abu Hafs al-Masri .
Al-Masri was killed during the war in Afghanistan .
Adel was a top member in the Egyptian Islamic militant movement Al - Jihad .
Al-Jihad was led by Zawahiri and carried out many attacks in Egypt in the 1990s .
Adel left Egypt at the end of the 1980s for a Gulf Arab country , then traveled to Pakistan and then Afghanistan , where he helped train militants at some camps , Egyptian sources said on condition they not be named .
The Egyptian sources also said that Adel is close to both Zawahiri and bin Laden .
A senior Saudi official said 030519 that he believed Adel directed the bombings in Riyadh .
A senior United States official stated that it was still not clear whether Adel had personally been involved .
Like Zawahiri , Adel and Al-Masri were on a list of 12 most wanted suspects released by the US administration following the 010911 attacks .

Indian troops already fighting rebels in Kashmir are now engaged in a massive campaign to destroy poppy crops in the region .
Troops are facing angry farmers unaware that poppy cultivation is now punishable as a drug trafficking offense .
Indian troops already fighting rebels are now also engaged in a massive operation to destroy poppy crops in Kashmir .
Customs officials from the Federal Finance Ministry launched the campaign with security forces on 15 May 2003 in the southern Kashmir already affected by much violence .
The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law .
Senior Customs Officer V. Prabhakar stated that in 2003 the troops have destroyed opium poppy crops dispersed over 224.73 hectares ( 556 acres ) in 27 villages of Anantnag and Pulwama districts .
A similar drive was carried out in 2002 in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting .
Prabhakar stated --
The crop destruction of 2002 has not served as a deterrent .
The State administration has been lax on the issue .
No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area .
Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) south of Kashmir 's summer capital Srinagar stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood .
Farmer Ghulam Ahmed stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone .
Ahmed stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest .
Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the Kashmiri bread known as kulcha .
Kulcha is always in great demand across the Himalayan region .
Bakers buy the seeds at 100 rupees ( two U.S. dollars ) per kilogram .
The lucrative byproduct is poppy SAP which can be processed into opium .
Rahti Begum was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed .
Begum who raises the 3 children of her late son stated that her poppy crop is her only source of income .
Some officials admit the residents are not at fault .
A State official told AFP --
These villagers are innocent .
They cultivate the crop for poppy seeds unaware that its cultivation is punishable .
The villagers are inadvertently involving themselves in drug trafficking .
Officials state that because many farmers are unaware of these laws security forces make no arrests over poppy cultivation .
Prabhakar states --
If the cultivation continues unrestrained Kashmir may soon become notorious for narcotics .
This has potential serious consequences as Kashmiri youth may become addicted to narcotics grown in the region .
Poppy cultivation at present is largely organized by groups who use their own trucks to transport the drugs for sale in other parts of India .
In 2002 the Indian army seized 350 kilograms ( 772 pounds ) of narcotics in the Kashmir Valley .
He will intensify the anti - drug operation .
Federal and state officials and non - governmental organizations should cooperate on the anti - drug campaign and could end the poppy trade in Kashmir .
A crucial element of the campaign 's success is education of the public .
The region of Kashmir is already unstable from 14 years of the separatist violence that has killed 10s of 1000s of people and has devastated their once prosperous tourism industry .

Charles Kartman stated on 030630 that the 5 billion United States dollar North Korean nuclear reactor project is contingent upon progress of discussions between North Korea and South Korea regarding North Korea 's desire to obtain nuclear weapons .
Officials stated that Charles Kartman made the statement during talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Yoon Young - kwan .
Charles Kartman is executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization .
Wi Sung - lac stated to reporters that Charles Kartman stated that the North Korean nuclear reactor project is linked to North Korea 's problem with nuclear weapons .
Wi Sung - lac is the head of the South Korean Foreign Ministry 's North American Affairs Bureau .
Wi Sung - lac stated that Charles Kartman stated that North Korea 's participation in the multilateral talks proposed by the United States to settle the nuclear crisis would help Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization resolve any policy differences over the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
Wi Sung - lac stated that Japan seems to have taken a similar position to south Korea and that there seems to be no determined policy despite various opinions in the United States .
Wi Sung - lac refused to give any details about the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
The Yonhap News Agency stated that Charles Kartman would reaffirm that the North Korean nuclear reactor project may not be completed if the North Korean government continued to pursue a nuclear agenda .
The United States Government has reportedly suggested the North Korean nuclear reactor project be halted as part of growing diplomatic pressure on the South Korean government .
South Korea has so far taken a cautious stance on the issue of the North Korean nuclear reactor project .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization was created under a 940000 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization was to provide North Korea with 2 light - water nuclear reactors deemed unsuitable for weapons production and 500000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil per year .
Construction on the 2 light - water nuclear reactors started in 020800 and is already behind schedule .
Construction on 1 of the 2 light - water nuclear reactors was originally planned to be completed in 030000 .
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization has maintained construction work on the 2 light - water nuclear reactors and has suspended shipments of fuel oil to North Korea from 021200 at the height of the nuclear stand - off which intensified in 021000 when the North Korean government admitted to running a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium .
The 940000 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States required North Korea to stop the use of graphite - moderate reactors used to produce weapons - grade plutonium at North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear plant .
North Korea did not adhere to the 940000 agreed framework .
North Korea unsealed spent fuel rods from the graphite - moderate reactors , removed International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and withdrew from a nuclear non - proliferation treaty .
On 030609 North Korea admitted publicly for the first time that North Korea was seeking nuclear weapons capability .
United States officials do not know how far North Korea 's nuclear weapons program has progressed .
United States officials believe the North Korean government has already stockpiled enough plutonium for 1 or 2 nuclear weapons .
North Korea and the United States sat down for their first talks in three - way negotiations with China in 030400 but no further meetings have been scheduled .
United States government is seeking support from its allies to cut North Korea 's alleged funding from the sales of arms , illegal drugs and currency counterfeiting .
North Korea has accused the United States of planning a blockade of North Korea .

The Chinese government 's recent conclusion that North Korea has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb has resulted in urgent diplomacy and plans for new talks .
Chinese deputy foreign minister was dispatched to North Korea to meet with Kim Jong - Il in an attempt to deescalate the situation .
Chinese diplomats were quoted in the Asian Wall Street Journal on 18 July 2003 as stating that China believes North Korea currently has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb .
This belief caused the Government of China to accelerate diplomacy to resolve the crisis and to dispatch Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo to Pyongyang , North Korea on 12 July 2003 in this effort .
China is North Korea 's closest ally .
North Korea is a Stalinist regime .
Dai is presently in Washington D.C. to inform top U.S. policymakers of the outcome of the rare meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il .
The newspaper stated that in recent weeks Chinese intelligence services concluded that North Korea is producing weapons - grade plutonium in sufficient quantities and possesses all the necessary components to assemble nuclear - tipped missiles .
A European official familiar with internal Chinese reports on the findings and Chinese diplomats were quoted in the newspaper as stating that the reprocessed plutonium is estimated to be sufficient to make at least 1 nuclear device .
The European official stated that North Korea has yet to combine the plutonium , triggering devices and other components into a bomb .
The Chinese reports in part verify recent claims made by the Government of North Korea that a number of spent nuclear fuel rods sealed in 1994 have been opened and have undergone reprocessing ostensibly to produce plutonium .
Until now China had stated that no evidence existed that North Korea was seeking nuclear weapons .
The U.S. government has been unable to confirm the North Korean government 's claims .
U.S. and South Korean officials have speculated that North Korea may have 1 or 2 nuclear bombs and may have the capacity to build 6 .
The Chinese government 's increasing concern was made evident by the new urgency of its diplomacy this week .
At a foreign ministry briefing on 17 July 2003 spokesman Kong Quan stated that the North Korean crisis was at a critical point .
Kong Quan stated that China is attempting to deescalate the situation by promoting talks and encouraging the 2 parties to make peace .
Kong Quan stated that it is important that the parties return to negotiations and continue with the trilateral talks that commenced in April 2003 .
The trilateral talks of April ended poorly with the North Korean government stating it possessed and might test nuclear weapons .
According to U.S. officials there is now a greater possibility that new talks could occur as North Korea appears willing to join another negotiating session with China and the United States .
There were also indications that the dialogue could be expanded to include Japan and South Korea .
South Korean officials have been quoted as saying that a dialogue could take place as early as August 2003 .
The United States government has always insisted on multilateral talks and has been eager to include its Japanese and South Korean allies .
North Korea has consistently demanded 1 - on - 1 talks with the U.S. government .
The Government of China emphasizes that it is more important to resume talks quickly than to refrain until the number of participants can be agreed upon .
China is a traditional ally and supplier of food and fuel to North Korea China and is therefore the country with the most leverage over North Korea .
China has demonstrated that it is willing to take advantage of this leverage .
Earlier in the crisis China stopped oil supplies to North Korea for several days .
2 days after North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il granted Dai the rare meeting for 14 July 2003 the regime 's Korean Central News Agency announced that China had recently decided to donate 10000 tons of diesel oil to North Korea .

Thailand will host ministers from China , Laos , India and Myanmar to discuss the elimination of precursor chemicals used in drug production .
Officials report that ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will hold talks this week in the northern Thai town of Chiang Rai aimed at eliminating precursor chemicals used in drug production .
The meeting will take place from 22 July 2003 - 25 July 2003 in one of the corners of the Golden Triangle and is the first of its kind .
The meeting will be attended by the ministers responsible for drug suppression in China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand .
Thai Justice Minister pongthep Thepkanjana will host the meeting .
Deputy chief of Thailand 's office of Narcotics Control Board ( ONCB ) rasanee Vistaveth stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand are expected to adopt the Chiang Rai Declaration which will touch on the countries ' commitment to solving the problem of drugs , particularly with regard to precursors and chemical trafficking .
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are contained in legal medicines and are used to produce illegal stimulants including speed or ice which are produced in large quantities in Myanmar and then trafficked to Thailand and China and beyond .
Chemical precursors are also used to turn raw opium into heroin .
Rasanee stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand expect to openly discuss their countries ' weak points and the measures each country is taking to control these substances and prevent the substances from reaching the Golden Triangle area .
Rasanee said the governments of China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will explore ways to cooperate to intercept the illegal substances which are also used in legitimate industries .
Rasanee stated every country has its own way of controlling precursors but as matter of fact many precursors still flood the Golden Triangle area .
The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will also address crop substitution initiatives for impoverished ethnic minorities who still rely on opium cultivation .
Rasanee referred to Thailand 's successful decades - long campaign to eliminate poppy growing from its territory and reported that Thailand is willing to help and share its own expertise on opium elimination by training officials .
The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will discuss how to find markets for goods produced under crop substitution and other related programs such as eco - tourism and handicraft manufacturing .

La times probe finds strong evidence that Iran appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The Los Angeles Times in the 030804 edition Summarized results of an independent probe which strongly indicated that Iran is striving to become the world 's next nuclear power and appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .
The Los Angeles Times said the 3 - month investigation drew on previously secret reports , international officials , independent experts , Iranian exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that Iran 's commercial program masked a military undertaking .
The Times report said that scientists from Russia , China , North Korea and Pakistan plus advancing technology have propelled Iran 's nuclear program much closer to producing a bomb than Iraq ever was .
The Times pointed out that some experts predict Iran might produce an initial atomic weapon in the next 2-3 years .
No one is certain about the actual time frame for Iran 's nuclear weapon production .
Nuclear materials :
The Times said a confidential report prepared by the French Government in 030500 concluded that Iran is surprisingly close to having enriched uranium or plutonium for a bomb .
A foreign intelligence service provided a copy of the report to the times .
The French government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to Iran and Iranian front companies .
The Times report said that samples of uranium taken by UN inspectors in Iran in 030600 tested positive for enrichment levels high enough to be consistent with an attempt to build a nuclear weapon .
The Iranian government also secretly imported 1.8 tons of nuclear material from China in 910000 and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal .
This uranium would be of no use in Iran 's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production .
foreign scientists ' involvement :
The Times quoted an unnamed Middle Eastern intelligence official that Pakistan 's role was bigger than thought from the beginning .
Abdul Qadeer Khan has helped Iran for years and is a Pakistani nuclear scientist regarded by the United States as a purveyor of nuclear secrets .
The Times said people inside Iran and foreign intelligence officials say that North Korean military scientists had been recently monitored entering Iranian nuclear facilities and are assisting in the design of a nuclear warhead .
There is a resort on the Caspian coast set aside for the exclusive use of North Koreans who are working on nuclear and missile projects in Iran .
This indicates the number of North Koreans working in Iran on such projects .
Russian scientists sometimes travel to Iran under false identities and work without the Russian government 's approval to help complete a special reactor that could produce weapons - grade plutonium .
New technology :
The report said Iranians have also approached European companies in recent months to buy devices that can manipulate large volumes of radioactive material .
This technology is for forging uranium metal and plutonium and switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon .
European intelligence sources said list of items the Iranians have wished to procure was a strong indication that Iran has moved to the late stages of weapons development .

Iran pledges to provide nuclear information to IAEA and sign nuclear protocol before 20040200 but not to indefinitely suspend uranium enrichment
20031129 Secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council and senior Iranian nuclear official Hassan Rowhani stated --
By 20040200 when director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency of the UN Mohammed El-Baradei presents a new report Iran will provide all required information and means of verification to the IAEA .
The Iranian government will soon authorize its representative to the IAEA to sign the additional protocol to the Non - Proliferation Treaty .
20031126 the IAEA passed a resolution condemning Iran for 18 years of covert nuclear activities .
The resolution contained a passage warning that any further non - proliferation breaches by Iran would occasion stern action .
The US demanded that the Iranian government be brought before the UN Security Council for possible sanctions while Britain , France and Germany demanded that Iran be rewarded for cooperating with the IAEA since 20031000 but neither demand was met by the resolution .
Prior to 20031129 Rowhani had made no statement after the 20031126 IAEA resolution .
Rowhani stated --
The suspension of uranium enrichment is provisional and voluntary and intended to build confidence .
Iran continues to refuse to indefinitely suspend its uranium enrichment activities and reserves the right to recommence enrichment at any moment .
Iran 's uranium enrichment has prompted international concern that Iran may be capable of constructing an atomic bomb .
Iran stated that the purpose its nuclear activities is peaceful .
Rowhani stated that Iran wants to use enriched uranium to supply fuel for a future civil center .
Rowhani stated that the Iranian government will discuss with European governments the transfer of modern technology , nuclear technology and fuel to Iran .
An unprecedented mission by the foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany in 20031000 convinced the Iranian government to --
Declare the entirety of the country 's nuclear activities .
Suspend uranium enrichment .
Sign the NPT additional protocol allowing stricter inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities .

German government sources stated that Wen Jiabao expressed interest in the plutonium - processing facility during the 031201 meeting with Gerhard Schroeder and that Gerhard Schroeder then promised to study Wen Jiabao 's request to purchase the plutonium - processing facility .
Gerhard Schroeder is on day 2 of a 3 day visit to China .
Gerhard Schroeder has visited China 5 times since 990000 and has focused the visits on boosting economic relations .
Gerhard Schroeder is accompanied by a strong business delegation including Siemens boss Heinrich von Pierer .
Any sale of plutonium - processing facility between China and Siemens is likely to be highly politically contentious and would need the approval of Gerhard Schroeder 's centre - left ruling coalition .
Gerhard Schroeder 's centre - left ruling coalition includes the environmentalist Greens .
A previous proposal to export the plutonium - processing facility to Russia collapsed in 010000 amid political concerns .
The political concerns were voiced by the Greens and others .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that Heinrich von Pierer stated that Siemens was beginning talks with interested Chinese parties about a sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that Heinrich von Pierer stated that Gerhard Schroeder stated that Gerhard Schroeder is not against the sale of the plutonium - processing facility in principle .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated to the Agence France - Presse that Siemens was confident about the outcome of the talks to sell the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany refrained from commenting on the political aspect of the sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that export permission would be needed from the German Government and that the speed of any sale of the plutonium - processing facility would be contingent upon obtaining the correct political support .
A Chinese delegation has already inspected the plutonium - processing facility at Hanau in western Germany and Siemens has lodged an application for an export licence .
A spokeswoman for Germany 's Federal exports office confirmed Siemens 's application for an export licence had been lodged with Germany 's Federal exports office .
A spokeswoman for Germany 's Federal exports office stated to Agence France - Presse that the application for an export licence was being studied at ministerial level due to the political considerations involved .
The political aspect of the sale of the plutonium - processing facility will be difficult to negotiate .
The plutonium - processing facility is described as Europe 's largest plutonium plant producing fuel for nuclear reactors and was completed in 910000 at a cost of 700 million euros .
The plutonium - processing facility never went into operation and was abandoned in 950000 .
The Hanau plutonium - processing facility was abandoned after safety concerns .
Siemens stated that the Hanau plutonium - processing facility was also abandoned due to political difficulties at a time of growing debate about the future of nuclear power .
The Environment Minister of Hesse state was the Greens member Joschka Fischer who is now Germany 's Foreign Minister .
Hesse state includes Hanau where the plutonium - processing facility is located .
The plutonium - processing facility is estimated to be worth about 50 million euros on 031202 .
Siemens would not comment on the plutonium - processing facility 's estimated value of 50 million euros .
The environmental group Greenpeace urged the German Government to refuse the sale of the plutonium - processing facility .
Greenpeace stated that any sale of the plutonium - processing facility would effectively mark a German contribution to political destabilisation in the Far East .
Greenpeace stated that the fuel of the plutonium - processing facility could be refined to extract weapons - grade material and that the plutonium - processing facility should be scrapped .

A Chinese company has discussed buying a plutonium factory from a German technology group .
German Defence Minister Peter Struck stated that Germany will export a plutonium facility to China only if China guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes .
4 December 2003 German Defense Minister Peter Struck stated that Germany will export a plutonium facility to China only if China guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes .
The export is controversial .
Struck spoke in an interview to the Neue Presse daily .
The ruling centre - left coalition has criticized the proposed sale of the plutonium facility .
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stated earlier this week he will investigate China 's request to buy the plutonium facility .
Schroeder recently visited China .
Struck stated --
Schroeder is correct to promise to examine the proposed exportation .
China must guarantee that the plutonium factory will not be used for military purposes but to produce atomic energy .
The sale is a highly emotional subject .
Struck is confident the coalition will settle its disagreements .
If China makes the guarantee struck will not be concerned about the sale of the facility .
Earlier on 4 December 2003 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao stated --
A Chinese company discussed a possible sale of the facility with owner German technology group Siemens .
The facility would be used for civil purposes and has no military goal .
The facility would have nothing to do with non - proliferation issues .
The facility was completed in 1991 .
The facility would have been Europe 's largest plant producing fuel for atomic power stations .
The facility never went into operation .
In 1995 the facility was abandoned under pressure from environmentalist party the Greens .
The Greens party is now junior partner in Schroeder 's coalition .
Senior green members such as co - leader Angelika Beer demand the sale to China be refused .
Germany is phasing out atomic energy for environmental reasons and senior green members state that it would be hypocritical of Germany to export an atomic energy facility .
According to press reports Greens Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has agreed to a sale .
Some members of of Schroeder 's Social Democrat Party protest the sale .
Schroeder has publicly expressed his support of the sale .
The plutonium facility is located in Hanau , western Germany .
Joschka Fischer is the Greens ' most charismatic figure .

Al-Qaeda officer Mohammed Hamdi al-Ahdal reveals under interrogation that Saudis and Yemenis were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in Yemen .
Sources close to the investigation said on 031216 that al-Qaeda officer Mohammed Hamdi al-Ahdal has revealed under interrogation that unnamed Saudis and Yemenis were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in Yemen .
Saudi - born adhal 's alias is Abu Issam al-Maki and was al-Qaeda 's leader in Yemen .
Ahdal was arrested 031100 .
Ahdal revealed that the financing of the attacks against the USS Cole in 001000 and the French supertanker Limburg in 021000 October and other terrorist attacks went through Ahdal and originated from Saudis and Yemenis residing outside .
Ahdal told investigators the money came in installments and in small quantities in order to avoid detection .
Ahdal told the investigators all the financial and technical preparations for the attacks of both the USS Cole and Limburg were supervised by Ahdal and revealed that one of the two suicide bombers in the USS Cole attack carried the family name of Al - thore .
The Saudi - owned Al-majala weekly magazine 's current edition said that Saudis and Yemenis were implicated in the terrorist attacks in Yemen .
Al-majala said the Government of Yemen informed Saudi authorities of information revealed by Ahdal under investigation reagrding Saudi persons involved in the funding and that Yemeni authorities are preparing to receive Saudi officers in joining the investigation .
Al-majala said Yemeni authorities refused a Saudi request asking for Ahdal to be extradited for interrogation in Saudi Arabia because the Yemeni Constitution disallows the handing over of Yemeni citizens regardless of any charges .
A Saudi team of investigators is currently in Yemen .
Yemeni authorities believe Ahdal is the second - in - command to Ali Qaed Sunian al-Harithi .
Ali Qaed Sunian al-Harithi 's alias was Abu Ali al-Harithi .
Harithi was among the six al-Qaeda suspects killed in November 021100 in a missile attack by the US Central Intelligence Agency in the desert region of Al-Naqaa east of Sanaa in Marib province .
Yemen is the ancestral homeland of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and has been under pressure from the US government since the 010911 attacks on the US to crack down on presumed Al-Qaeda militants .

Live poultry smuggling undermines WHO and FAO efforts to restrict bird flu spread in Asia .
FAO and WHO advise countries to tighten border security .
Smugglers are undermining international efforts headed by the UN World Health Organization ( WHO ) and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) to eradicate bird flu by trafficking illegal live poultry that threaten to spread the disease to new areas .
Attempts to halt bird flu spread --
Agriculture and customs officials have increased border checks throughout the affected region to halt illicit trade .
Recent arrests of live poultry smugglers have occurred at checkpoints .
Most affected Asian countries have banned the import and export of live and slaughtered poultry to prevent the movement of potentially infected chickens and ducks across borders .
Senior FAO Animal Production and Health Officer in Asia Hans Wagner stated --
The FAO is concerned and well aware that there is copious uncontrolled movement of animals between borders in some Asian countries .
Smuggling occurs chiefly across the Green or uncontrolled borders of Vietnam , Laos , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar and China is likely a source for spreading the flu and other diseases .
Authorities in Vietnam stated that smuggling of meat and fruit from China has increased drastically in the past year .
Vietnam has experienced 9 flu fatalities and is the country worst affected by the disease .
Preventing smuggling from Vietnam is difficult because the country 's extensive land borders with China , Laos and Cambodia are poorly controlled by a notoriously corrupt customs department .
Most nations have tightened border controls in accordance with FAO and WHO advisories .
20040120 Cambodian authorities detained 10 in the southern province of Ta KEO for importing over 150000 duck eggs from Vietnam .
Cambodia has continuously been combating chicken and egg smuggling from Vietnam and is on high alert .
20040202 Taiwan tightened security against smugglers following the discovery in 20031200 of H 5N1 in ducks smuggled from mainland China .
Taiwan has previously successfully controlled an outbreak of the milder H 5N2 flu strain .
Taiwanese coastguards increased patrols around the island and several island groups off the Chinese mainland .
Approximately 8000 poultry and pig farmers were vaccinated against human flu to prevent it mutating with bird flu strains .
India is free of the disease but has deployed hundreds of soldiers to the border with Myanmar .
Myanmar has no reported H 5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand .
Thailand is one of the countries worst affected by the virus .
Hong Kong authorities have increased security along the border with China .
The Government stated that illegally slaughtered poultry imports increased by 15 percent from 2002 to 2003 .
The Customs and Excise Department reportedly seized 29266 kilograms of chilled or frozen poultry in 2003 compared with 1749 kilograms in 2002 .
Customs spokesman Richard law stated that the Department performs frequent checks on smuggling activities and have now increased efforts to inspect cargoes .
The H 5N1 flu strain has caused 13 deaths and reported outbreaks in 10 countries .

Volkswagen AG rejects a Chinese newspaper report that it had put a stop to technology transfers of its Santana sedans to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .
The China Business Post reported 040209 that German auto giant Volkswagen AG had decided against the further transfer of a technical platform for the Santana sedan model to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .
Discontinuing these technology transfers would cause several millions of yuan 's of losses to SAIC .
The China Business Post said SAIC had invested large sums in the scheduled acquisition of the Platform , including acquiring an auto manufacturing plant in Yizheng city in eastern Jiangsu province .
The reported plan was for SAIC to produce a new sedan model designed on the Santana platform and with the car set to be launched in 040500 .
The China Business Post said the termination was due in part to Volkswagen 's adjustment of strategies regarding China and to ineffective communication with Volkswagen 's Chinese partners .
Volkswagen on 040209 rejected this China Business Post report that Volkswagen had put a stop to technology transfers of Santana sedans to SAIC .
Volkswagen group China spokeswoman Melanie Behrens said that the statements made in the China Business Post about the stop of knowledge transfer from VW to SAIC are not true .
Behrens said that Volkswagen does not know where these claims came from and is still working on the subject and trying to clarify the situation .
SAIC was not immediately available for comment .
SAIC also has a joint venture with US - based General Motors .
Analysts said this issue highlights what might be an increasing problem for foreign auto makers as China 's government increases support of domestic car companies in hopes of building stand - alone name brands .
Many Chinese car - makers with overseas venture partners have begun researching and developing cars independently .
Volkswagen is China 's number one passenger car - maker and has two joint ventures in China , Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company and Faw ( First Automotive Works ) Volkswagen Automotive Company .
Approximately 633000 of Volkswagen 's own cars were sold in China in 030000 , up from 510000 in 020000 .
SAIC sold a total of 800000 sedans in 030000 .
SAIC 's sedan sales topped other domestic auto makers , most of which are volkswagens and General Motors ' buicks .

A draft report prepared for the EU executive stated that the European Union should massively increase research on security issues in order to better protect civilians from terrorist attacks .
The report is created by a working group including Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin and enterprise Commissioner Erkki Liikanen .
It recommends that up to two billion euros be spent per year on a vast pan - European research program .
The European Security Research Program ( ESRP ) would receive EU funding beginning in 2007 .
It is the most ambitious of several recommendations the group is likely to issue when it presents its final conclusions in two or three weeks .
The draft report recommends starting security research funding with one billion euros per year in 2007 .
It will then slowly increase the annual budget to two billion euros .
European spending currently lags behind the United States .
The United States ' Homeland Security Department receives one billion dollars annually plus research credit from the Defense Department .
The report stated that there is no reason why European Security Research should not be funded at a level similar to the United States .
The European Commission strategy allows for a preliminary period of studies and pilot projects from 2004 to 2006 .
It promotes EU - wide synergies in research on top safety issues including protection against bio - terrorism and improved networking between civilian and military authorities across the continent .
65 million euros have been earmarked for the 2004-2006 phase of the research program according to an exploratory Plan of Action presented by the Commission on February 3 , 2004 .
The Working Group on security research was formed last October and includes EU parliamentarians and experts from related industries in addition to the two commissioners .

French anti - terrorist judge calls terrorism serious threat despite dispersal and weakening of al-Qaeda .
Restraining extremist groups is becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
France 's top anti - terrorist judge Jean - Louis Bruguiere stated to AFP 29 February 2004 that al-Qaeda is still capable of inspiring people to carry out attacks despite being much weaker since the 11 September 2001 attacks and the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan .
Bruguiere has led the French legal effort against extremism and terrorism in recent years .
Bruguiere stated --
The global fight against terrorism is against an increasingly elusive enemy with access to funds virtually impossible to control .
The threat comes from long - standing members of al-Qaeda .
Al-Qaeda is an organization which still exists but has been significantly weakened by the neutralization and capture of a number of its members and of those in charge .
In an interview in Monaco Bruguiere called global terrorism a scattered and polymorphous threat .
Bruguiere was in Monaco attending a meeting of the international organization involved in Mediterranean political studies called club of Monaco .
Dozens of alleged members of al-Qaeda have been captured or killed since the group claimed responsibility for the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington D.C. but authorities have not been able to locate al-Qaeda 's leader Osama bin Laden or his top deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri .
On 24 February 2004 Zawahiri appeared in 2 taped messages broadcast by the Arab - language Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazeera television stations calling in remarks attributed to him for renewed attacks on the United States .
Bruguiere stated --
Restraining extremist groups particularly across Europe was becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .
The networks operating in Europe benefit from micro - financing and not from macro - financing .
Fraudulent charge cards could be used to withdraw significant sums which are then distributed through micro - channels outside the classic financial circles and are practically impossible to detect .
Use of false credit cards is growing .
It is necessary to expand existing laws to combat the funding mechanisms .
All existing legal or institutional measures are insufficient to neutralize this threat .
Al-Qaeda is only 1 of many worldwide threats among the many radical Islamic organizations involved in an international jihad and sharing the al-Qaeda strategy that are pursuing regional options .
The groups are particularly active in Africa , Asia and Europe .
Bruguiere made these comments before going into a meeting with approximately 40 high - ranking or former top international officials .
Since the September 2001 strikes on the United States deadly large - scale attacks have occurred in other parts of the world .
Among the targets have been a synagogue in northern Tunisia , a nightclub in Bali , a hotel in Kenya and numerous locations in Chechnya and Russia .
Analysts have warned that Iraq could become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations if a political solution is not found soon .
The United States and Britain invaded Iraq nearly a year ago despite massive international opposition .

Amnesty International urges Laos to treat surrendered ethnic Hmong rebels humanely while Lao officials claim there are no rebels and no insurgency .
The rights group states that Lao troops promised rebels amnesty and a living area if they surrender but has received conflicting reports as to whether the Lao Government has upheld this agreement .
On 05 March 2004 Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to ensure that 100s of ethnic Hmong anti - government insurgents and their families who had reportedly surrendered were treated humanely .
From its London headquarters Amnesty International issued a statement saying that the Lao People 's Democratic Republic has international obligations in this regard under the Geneva Conventions and the 2 UN covenants .
On 03 March 2004 the U.S. government - funded network Radio Free Asia reported --
Up to 700 insurgents and their relatives and 8 rebel commanders surrendered after government troops surrounded several northern holdouts in late February 2004 .
Troops used leaflets and megaphones to help communicate to the rebels that authorities would grant them amnesty and a special living area if they surrendered .
Approximately 300 people surrendered near Luang Prabang after traveling on foot from farther north and between 300 and 400 people surrendered in Xieng Khouang province .
Amnesty International stated it had received conflicting reports as to their reception and treatment by the authorities .
Lao Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yong Chanthalangsy denied that anyone had surrendered insisting also that there were no rebels in the impoverished communist nation .
Yong Chanthalangsy told AFP that no one surrendered , that there are no rebels and there is no war in Laos .
Yong Chanthalangsy stated that there are many people coming out of the forests to take advantage of Lao poverty eradication programs .
Following a series of deadly highway ambushes and bomb blasts the Lao Government called in August 2003 on Hmong and others whom they called ethnic minority bandits to lay down their arms , to come out from the forest and to rejoin society .
The Lao Government warned that failure to do so would result in heavy consequences .
Small bands of ethnic minority rebels predominantly Hmong remain from the CIA - sponsored guerrilla army mobilized to wage the United States ' secret campaign in Laos during the Vietnam War .
Some 300000 Hmong fled to Thailand after the Communist takeover in Laos in 1975 but the remaining rebels have continued a low - level , ineffective insurgency for nearly three decades .
The Lao military has been accused by human rights groups of using harsh and often brutal tactics to eliminate them .
Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to provide UN agencies and other non - governmental organizations access to all those who have put down their arms in order to assist with basic humanitarian needs .
Amnesty International stated --
Longer term assistance with their reintegration into Lao society will also be needed .
It is essential that neutral observers are given access to these groups of former rebels in order to independently assess their situation and the veracity of ongoing claims of serious human rights violations being made by overseas ethnic Hmong groups .
The Lao Government should seize this opportunity to find a peaceful solution to decades of fighting and the high human cost on all sides of the conflict .
In January 2004 , U.S. - based Lao exiles warned that Lao forces had launched a new offensive against 1000s of Hmong rebels and civilians and accused the communist regime of using starvation as a weapon of war .

Desiring admission into the European Union , Albanian government increased efforts against drug trafficking by strengthening laws , seizing illegal drugs , and investigating possibly corrupt police officials .
Under the pressure of the European Union the Albanian Government has escalated its fight against drug trafficking by preparing a new strategy to halt the smuggling of hashish and heroin over Albanian territory from Asia towards the West .
A recent EU report on Albania stated the situation in Albania , which has remained an important country for the traffic of narcotics , is worrisome .
The report suggested the Tirana government adopt an efficient strategy in the Government 's efforts against drug trafficking .
Albanian interior minister Igli Toska stated --
The fight against drug trafficking will be the Albanian government 's main challenge in 2004 .
The Albanian Government has been working on a project of national strategy which will require international support and cooperation .
Albania 's geographic position , Albania 's trade with Turkey and Greece , and the situation after the Kosovo war are all elements Albanian criminal groups profit from , thereby making Albania an important stop for the transit of narcotics .
In July 2004 the Albanian government plans to present a set of anti - Mafia laws which will allow confiscation of property belonging to persons involved in criminal and illegal activities .
Albanian justice minister Adrian dvorani stated the anti - Mafia laws also provide for the special protection of witnesses or people involved in illegal trafficking who decide to testify and will enable a more efficient strategy .
Albanian officials aspire to EU membership .
The Albanian government has made a significant development in the government 's fight against drug smugglers in 2004 .
In 2003 Albanian police infiltrated an international drug network operating between Kosovo , Macedonia , Albania and Italy and controlled by the Kosovo Albanian and Turkish criminal groups linked with the Calabrian Mafia organization N'Drangheta .
In May 2004 approximately 100 policemen -- 25 of them in top positions -- were dismissed on suspected ties with organized crime .
60 others have been investigated on similar charges .
Toska stated there will be no smugglers without corrupted policemen and Toska announced tougher measures against policemen and security officials linked with criminal groups .
The EU report quotes the names of several Albanian politicians directly or indirectly involved in drugs trafficking but no measures have so far been taken against the politicians .
Albanian police forces have seized more than 200 kilos ( 440 pounds ) of heroin and around 8 tons of cannabis between November 2003 and May 2004 , double that which was seized in 2003 .
Experts say the figures of drugs seized are insignificant compared to the estimated quantities of narcotics that are smuggled through Albania .
International Police experts based in Tirana estimate the value of the narcotics in transit at over 2 billion dollars ( about 1.6 billion euros ) per year .
Experts estimate the amount smuggled through Albania makes up approximately 25 to 30 percent of the narcotics smuggled into the European market from the Balkans .
Albanian police official Xhavit Shala stated Albanian smugglers are linked to the international criminal organizations like ( the Italian ) sacra Corona UNITA , Cosa Nostra , the Turkish , Russian , Macedonian and Kosovar mafia , and the Colombian drug cartels .
Bujar Mema of the Albanian Interpol Office stated that drug smugglers have reappeared due to increasing consumption of narcotics in Europe and the production of opium from Afghanistan , which has reached the level of the years before the US intervention in 2001 with 3600 tons produced in 2003 .

On 26 June 2004 Myanmar 's military rulers burned over 710 kilograms of opium , 353 kilograms of heroin , 2.6 million methamphetamine pills , and other drugs in a make - shift incinerator set up at Yangon 's drugs Elimination Museum .
International diplomats witnessed the incineration .
The incinerated drugs had a total value of approximately 247 million dollars .
Myanmar 's military rulers incinerated the drugs to mark the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking .
One of the heads Myanmar 's Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control , General Khin yii , stated the drug incineration on 26 June 2004 was the 18th time the regime had incinerated tons of illegal narcotics .
Khin yii stated that 14.45 billion dollars worth of drugs have been destroyed since the drug destroying events began in 1990 .
Khin yii stated that opium production and poppy cultivation has declined since 1990 but that methamphetamines are replacing opium as the main choice of traffickers .
Khin yii stated that stimulant tablets are becoming a threat but did not elaborate on the extent of methamphetamine production or trafficking .
The United Nations stated that opium production has declined by 24 percent in Myanmar since 2003 .
In March 2004 the United States stated that while Myanmar had reduced poppy cultivation Myanmar remained the world 's 2nd ranked supplier of opium from which derivatives such as heroin are made .
Thai government stated in early 2004 that Thai government was considering building a high - security fence along Thailand 's border with Myanmar in a bid to stop smugglers trafficking illegal drugs into Thailand .

During the mass Ortega crossed himself and asked Obando to forgive him .
Obando stated that the pardon that has been offered and accepted is an indispensable premise of a stable and durable peace .
The Sandinistas have been accused of persecuting Catholic priests during the 1979-1990 Sandinista rule .
The Sandinistas accused the Church of anti - government activities .
The Sandinista National Liberation Front ( FSLN ) is currently Nicaragua 's primary political opposition group .
The Sandinista group is named after Agusto Cesar Sandino .

Cyber attacks target Japanese Foreign Ministry homepage .
A Japanese official blames South Korean hackers for the attacks , citing the passage of a Japanese resolution that stressed the Japanese government 's claim to an island chain controlled by South Korea .
A massive amount of information flooded the homepage of the Japanese Foreign Ministry , www.mofa.go.jp , beginning at 9:50 am ( 0050 GMT ) on 17 March 2005 .
Access to the website has been erratic .
Japanese foreign press secretary Hatsuhisa Takashima termed the flood of information a cyber attack and stated that officials are working to fix the problem .
Kyodo News cited a Japanese government source and stated the latest attack may have come from South Korea .
On 16 March 2005 a Japanese local assembly passed a resolution stressing the Japanese government 's claim to a small island chain controlled by South Korea .
Anti - Japanese protests occurred in Seoul after the passage of the resolution .
Japanese government websites have come under occasional cyber attacks especially from countries which Japan invaded in the first half of the 20th century .
In January 2005 , administrators of the Yasukuni Shrine dedicated to Japan 's war dead stated the Yasukuni Shrine 's website had been the target of Internet attacks .
Most of these attacks were via e-mails written in Chinese .
In 2000 , hackers accessed Japanese government websites and left messages in Chinese and English ranging from insults to attacks on Japan 's wartime past , after Japanese conservative groups held a forum in the western city of Osaka to deny the 1937 massacre in the Chinese city of Nanjing by Japanese troops .

Taiwan 's chip company United Microelectronics Corp ( UMC ) announced on March 21 , 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in China - based chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package .
Taiwan 's chip company United Microelectronics Corp ( UMC ) announced on March 21 , 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in China - based chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package .
The stake was valued at 3.5 billion Taiwan dollars ( 110 million US dollars ) and the investment goes to the core of cross - Straits investment ties .
Both companies are being investigated in Taiwan for alleged breach of trust .
UMC Chairman Robert Tsao said the company had submitted a letter to Taiwan 's Investment Commission asking for assistance in transferring the stake .
It said it was compensation for previous assistance .
UMC manufactures cutting - edge microchips .
The chips are installed in a wide range of computers and electronics found in mobile phones , televisions and cars .
The technology is highly prized in Taiwan .
Market analysts believe the assistance involved a technology transfer from UMC to hejian and the compensation through the stake represents a payment .
No cash changed hands .
Tsao said the letter followed a verbal promise made by hejian technology to pay UMC a reasonable amount of compensation .
That included a commitment to merge the two companies .
Tsao said no formal written agreements had been signed .
Both companies would next seek a strategic partnership if the Investment Commission approved the deal .
UMC is the world 's second largest wafer foundry and has recognized its investment in hejian which had previously been denied .
Taiwan authorities lifted a ban in March 2002 on mainland - bound investment in eight - inch ( 200 millimeter ) silicon wafer plants .
This followed assurances from potential investors that the island would not lose out on transferred technology .
Prosecutors raided the homes and offices of UMC executives in February 2005 as part of a probe into the alleged illegal supply of funds , technology and human resources to hejian .
Hejian was founded in November 2001 with capital of 350 million U.S. dollars .
Its Chairman Hsu Chien - hua has been barred from leaving Taiwan after being bailed out of police custody for 10 million Taiwan dollars .
Tsao and UMC vice chairman John hsuan have also been named as defendants in on - going investigations .
UMC has never sought government approval for China - bound investments .
The company has previously called hejian technology a friendly company while denying any financial ties between the two .
Only UMC peer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has received official approval to build a plant in Shanghai .
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the world 's biggest contract microchip - maker .

Software protection companies warn of a new form of cyper - attack called ransomware .
If it installs successfully , ransomware encrypts text files and displays a ransom note demanding 200 dollars to supply decryption software to restore the data to its original form .
20050601 anti - virus program manufacturer Symantec stated on its website ( http://www.Symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/Trojan.pgpcoder.html ) that the attacking program is a Trojan horse .
Trojan horses do not replicate from machine to machine as viruses do .
Symantec stated that the ransomware enters the computer via weaknesses in the victim 's Web browser and then scans the hard drive and encrypts any text - based documents found .
20050604 the British weekly New Scientist stated that 1 case of ransomware has been discovered which may pioneer a new and dangerous generation of malicious software .
The known ransomware program is titled pgpcoder in an attempt to undermine the legal , popular and highly secure encryption product pretty good privacy .
New Scientist stated that the California web - filtering company websense discovered pgpcoder and notified the FBI .
Pgpcoder used an unsophisticated algorithm to encrypt the data so that a computer consultant was able to decode the documents easily .
New Scientist stated that future virus writers may compel victims to pay by encrypting files using military - grade systems .
Ransomware 's weakness is that the demand includes a traceable contact email address and electronic bank account .

On June 3 , 2005 Israeli military officials stated in the New York Times that Syria test fired three Scud missiles a week ago in an act of defiance to the United States and the United Nations .
One of the missiles broke up over two Turkish villages .
It caused no injuries .
The officials stated the missile tests were normal .
It was Syria 's first since 2001 and caused embarrassment to Turkey .
Syria decided to make the missile tests public because the U.S. silence about them was unsettling .
The Israeli officials in Tel Aviv told the daily that the missile tests were part of a Syrian missile development project using North Korean technology .
The three missiles were the older Scud B that has a range of 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) and two Scud D 's with a range of 700 kilometers ( 435 miles ) .
The missiles are designed to deliver air - burst chemical weapons .
The official said the launchings on May 27 , 2003 were Syrian President Bashir al-Assad 's response to U.S. and UN pressures that forced al-Assad to withdraw Syrian troops from neighboring Lebanon .
This was in the wake of the February assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Harari .
A senior Israeli military official said the tests are probably needed for the missile project but Bashir is taking a risk and sending a message .
Anti - Syrian journalist Samir kassir was killed June 2 , 2005 when a bomb exploded under kassir 's car in Beirut .
The attack is blamed on the pro - Syrian regime and widely condemned at home and abroad .
Syria angrily denied the accusations through its official news agency , SANA .
The Israeli officials said the Syrian missiles were launched from northern Syria Newar minakh .
One was sent about 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) to southernmost Syria near the Jordanian border .
The missile that that broke up was launched southwest toward the Mediterranean , over the Turkish province of Hatay and shed debris over two villages there .
The Israelis said they had film of the launching and breakup .
The Turkish Ambassador to the United States Osman Faruk Logoglu told The New York Times there were no casualties in the missile breakup .
Osman Faruk Logoglu added that Syria had apologized for the technical mishap .

The China Times stated that the Hsiung Feng cruise missile was developed by the military - run chungshan Institute of Science and Technology , has a range of 1,000 kilometers ( 600 miles ) and could be used to attack military bases in southeast China .
The China Times stated that once the missile was deployed it would mark the first time that Taiwan is able to put strategic weapons into use and that the political and military impact of this would be far - reaching .
The Times said Defense Minister Lee jye witnessed the test firing of the missile from chiupeng military base in the southern Pingtung County and that the missile flew over 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) before hitting its target .
The defense ministry declined to comment on the report .
The report did not specify when the test took place but speculated that it could have been in March .
The missile is expected to go into pilot production later in 050000 or 060000 .
Taiwan is striving to build up its missile defense capabilities to counter the military threat from China .
Officials state that China has targeted Taiwan with approximately 700 ballistic missiles .
Taiwan 's cabinet approved a revised arms deal with the United States in 050500 worth almost 15.5 billion dollars after a previous proposal was rejected by parliament .
The arms package over a 15 - year period beginning in 050000 includes 8 conventional submarines , a modified version of the Patriot anti - missile system and a fleet of anti - submarine aircraft .
The package is pending final approval by Parliament .

Brazilian government and Abbott Laboratories agree on lower price for AIDS drug Kaletra in response to Brazilian threat to violate the patent .
According to WHO studies the price of the drug was exorbitant and the Brazilian government demanded that Abbot lower the price .
On 08 July 2005 Brazil 's Ministry of Health stated that U.S. company Abbott Laboratories has agreed to reduce the price of its HIV / AIDS drug Kaletra to prevent Brazil from violating the company 's patent as it had threatened .
The ministry said in a statement --
The agreement made with Abbott guarantees the Ministry 's proposed objectives ensuring a significant price cut for the drug over the next 6 years .
Abbott agreed to a technology transfer procedure so that Brazil 's state - run farmanguinhos laboratories can begin producing Kaletra in 2009 .
The agreement guarantees access to Meltrex by Brazilian patients .
Meltrex is an updated version of Kaletra that is pending approval by U.S. health authorities .
Over the 6 years which the Agreement covers Brazil expects to save up to 259 million U.S. dollars in drug purchases .
The Ministry recently stated that an agreement with Abbott would save Brazil 18 million U.S. dollars in its 2006 budget to provide AIDS patients free anti - AIDS treatment consisting of a cocktail of anti - retroviral drugs including Kaletra .
Currently 24000 patients in Brazil receive Kaletra .
The number is expected to increase to 60000 by 2011 .
On 24 June 2005 Brazil declared Kaletra a drug of national interest and demanded that Abbott decide within 10 days to either agree to lower its price for the drug or face a violation of its patent .
On 24 June 2005 Brazilian Health Minister Humberto Costa stated that the price paid by the Brazilian Government to purchase Kaletra represented a yearly cost of 2630 U.S. dollars per patient .
Costa stated that this price is considered exorbitant because studies of the World Health Organization ( WTO ) showed that for large - scale production the fair price including a considerable margin of profit should range from 480 to 540 U.S. dollars per patient per year .
Costa stated that Brazil planned to have a less expensive generic copy of the patented drug produced locally by a state - owned company .
Illinois - based Abbott stated that Brazil 's demands were illegal and warned that developing unproven alternative HIV medication posed significant consequences for patients .
Abbott stated that it remained open to an agreeable solution .

Pakistani analysts say that Pakistan 's network of madrassas has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain , who supply them with extremist recruits and funding .
Pakistani analysts said on 050715 that Pakistan 's network of madrassa Islamic schools has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain , who supply them with extremist recruits and vital funding .
On 050714 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw expressed concern over what goes on in some Pakistani madrassas .
It has emerged that Shehzad Tanweer was one of the terrorists who carried out the bombing of an underground subway train at Aldgate in east London .
Tanweer was said by his uncle to have gone in 041200 to a Pakistani madrassa , wanting to learn to recite the Koran by heart .
Sources in Pakistan said that British authorities should look inside British borders where the South Asian community is turning to increasingly extremist religious views .
Kamila hyat of Pakistan 's Human Rights Commision said that militancy is being exported in the reverse direction .
Younger Pakistanis coming from Britain have very extreme and hard - line views and view British culture as decadent .
When Pakistani - British youngsters come to Pakistan they are surprised to see women walking around without burqas .
Analysts say Tanweer 's trip to Pakistan was by no means unusual , as many Pakistani families who emigrated some 40 or 50 years ago and settled in Britain send their children for religious teaching at madrassas .
Hyat said they want to ensure their children are not alienated from their family faith and hope a brief stint of a few terms will help ground them in Islamic and Pakistani culture .
Hyat said that complaints have nonetheless been received from parents in Pakistan who are very concerned about teenagers who graduate and then go back to the UK for University .
The parents of some madrassa students are saying that the young men are somewhat confused when away from the UK for the first time and are consistently being approached by other Pakistanis or by Arabs who attempt to get them to join extremist groups .
Such students bring extremism back to the UK when coming back home .
Madrassas continue to produce a peculiar state of mind in students , said Hasan Askari .
Askari is the former head of political science department at Lahore 's Punjab University .
Askari said that these students having a state of mind of religious orthodoxy are vulnerable to violence and extremism .
Some of the radical religious schools in Pakistan have thrived on funds regularly coming from supporters among the Muslim community in Britain .
Security sources say that in one case , several thousand pounds were sent to outlawed Sipah - e - Sahaba of Pakistan in 030000 .
Pakistani security officials informed the British authorities and identified the man who sent the money as Mullah Hamid .
Mullah Hamid was a prayer leader in a mosque in Glasgow .
Pakistan admits that some of the estimated 10,000 madrassas in Pakistan are breeding grounds for extremism .
Madrassas have been a part of Muslim social life on the Indian subcontinent for decades .
In the 1980s they became a recruiting ground for the US - sponsored militant movement against the Soviet occupation of neighboring Afghanistan .
President Pervez Musharraf has been campaigning since early 030000 for reform of madrassas .
Many madrassas are unregulated and the International Crisis Group says 1.5 million students attend such Islamic schools .
Education Minister Javed Ashraf stated on 050715 that efforts were working to get madrassa leaders to broaden the curriculum beyond rote Koranic learning and to encompass useful and employable skills .

20050705 terrorist attacks may prompt counter - extremism measures sufficient to force Islamist militant organizations in London into convert operations via the Internet .
Anti - terrorist laws in the UK strengthened and suspected extremists were pursued more aggressively after the 20010911 attacks in the US .
The 20050707 terrorist attacks that killed 56 on London underground trains and a double - decker bus prompted demands for further anti - terror laws and surveillance of Islamist militants .
Director of the Center for the Study of terrorism at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland Magnus ranstorp stated that the militants may be forced underground into the cybersphere , which has potential utility for command , communication , and especially recruitment .
Londonistan is the Islamist core operating in London .
The two main components of londonistan are the international Jihad Movement and the exiled opposition to current Arab or Muslim regimes .
Londonistan emerged in the 1990s because London was a center for finance and Arabic media and because of Britain 's lenient asylum laws .
20050718 the Royal Institute of International Affairs ( Chatham House ) stated --
By the mid - 1990s British intelligence agencies and police were aware that London was expanding as a base for promoters , funders , and planners of terrorism in the Middle East and elsewhere .
Officials did not perceive any threat to national security and the individuals continued their activities with relative impunity .
Ranstorm stated that the militants have previously cautiously avoided incitement to violence .
Foreign Governments opposed the British government 's passive policy .
Government crackdown --
In 2004 British authorities dismantled the Finsbury Park mosque in London , the previous venue of Salafist jihadists .
Since then the militants have moved to informal areas , study groups , and youth centers .
The former imam of Finsbury Park mosque is Egyptian - born Abu Hamza al-Masri .
Masri is crippled with 1 eye and 1 arm and is incarcerated in Belmarsh prison awaiting a 20060100 trial on charges of inciting racial hatred and murder .
Abu Qatada is a Palestinian considered the spiritual chief for Al-Qaeda in Europe .
He is under house arrest after serving 2.5 years at Belmarsh .
French researcher Dominique Thomas stated --
The remaining preachers must adopt a clandestine attitude or risk surveillance or arrest .
Islamist groups such as those seeking reform in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , or Libya will be stymied .
Londonistan 's imminent disappearance may force militants to seek a clandestine meeting place on the Internet .
There are a number of websites managed or administered from London and the Internet facilitates global connection .

China 's research and development spending will catch up with that of the EU in 090000 or 100000 if current spending trends continue .
Conditions for research and development in some emerging markets like China may be surpassing Europe 's , so European companies are transferring some of their investments there .
The Financial Times reported 051010 that in just 5 years China will be spending proportionally more on research and development than the European Union .
EU Commissioner for research Janez Potocnik told the Financial Times that the Chinese trend is extremely clear .
Potocnik said that China will catch up with the EU in 090000 or 100000 if the trend continues .
The Financial Times said research and development investment in China was 1.31 percent of GDP in 030000 but is rising at a double - digit rate .
The Financial Times said that at present growth rates , the EU 's public and private spending on research and development is set to rise from 1.93 percent of gross domestic product in 030000 to 2.2 percent in 100000 .
This is well short of the 3 percent target agreed by EU heads of government as part of the 020000 Lisbon Strategy .
Potocnik was quoted as saying that the conditions for research and development in some emerging markets like China are improving and it is obvious that European companies are transferring some of their investments there .
Potocnik is worried about Europe 's unfavorable research and development environment ranging from excessive red tape to insufficient corporate tax incentives and continued divergences in intellectual property protection and patenting .
In response to the research and development boom in countries such as China and India , the EU government will this week table new proposals to help retain and attract research funding in the EU .
An EU government plan to double the EU 's own research and development budget to 70 billion euro over 060000-110000 was shelved in June amid a dispute among EU leaders over future EU funding .

Deadly attacks in India continue despite deaths of Pakistani Kashmir rebels and destruction of group infrastructure due to earthquake .
There is conflicting opinion as to the extent of damage suffered by the insurgency .
Rebel fighting continues despite losses suffered by Islamic rebels in Pakistan - ruled Kashmir in the massive earthquake .
The Indian government is attempting to assess the extent of losses suffered by rebels .
Police stated that on 18 October 2005 2 militants entered the fortified Srinagar home of junior Education Minister Ghulam Nabi lone of the People 's Democratic Party ( PDF ) and shot him to death .
2 policemen and 1 of the attackers also died and 5 others were injured in the gunfight .
The attack occurred less than 1 day after suspected rebels shot and killed a prominent communist politician in Indian Kashmir .
The daily violence has continued despite a ceasefire declaration in areas affected by the 08 October 2005 earthquake .
The violence that has occurred since the earthquake has been attributed to an umbrella group of separatists called the United Jihad Council .
Some insurgents have joined relief efforts .
The Indian military has not reacted to insurgents ' relief efforts and has continued counter - insurgency operations .
The army states that while it directs aid work it has also killed more than 30 militants since the earthquake .
Federal Intelligence agencies have been working to assess the damage to insurgents in and around Muzaffarabad .
Muzaffarabad is the militants ' headquarters and the capital of Pakistani Kashmir .
Army chief General J. J. Singh stated --
The epicenter of the 7.6 - magnitude earthquake was in Muzaffarabad and caused damage among the militant groups .
All the terrorist infrastructure in and around Muzaffarabad was destroyed and many innocent people died .
It is premature to state with certainty what impact the earthquake has had on the militant groups as infrastructure remains intact in other areas in Pakistan .
The militant groups are seeking either independence for Kashmir or absorption into Pakistan .
Over 1300 people in Indian Kashmir and 41000 people in Pakistan were killed in the earthquake .
The Indian government accuses the Pakistani government of training , arming and funding the Islamic rebellion .
The Pakistani government denies this charge but states that it does extend moral , political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists .
Head of military operations in Indian Kashmir Brigadier Madan Gopal expressed confidence on 17 October 2005 that many of the militants had been killed .
Gopal stated that the Hizbul Mujahedin and the Lashkar - e - Toiba have suffered major losses in the earthquake on the Pakistani side .
Hizbul Mujahedin and Lashkar - e - Toiba are groups that carry out frequent attacks .
Violence continues despite conflicting opinion on the extent of damage suffered by the rebel groups .
Retired General V. N. Sharma rejects suggestions that the earthquake has critically damaged the core of the insurgency .
Sharma was India 's army chief when the insurgency erupted in 1989 .
Sharma states that such suggestions are unrealistic .
Sharma states that he does not think the insurgency has been destroyed because the groups are mobile units and live in tented accommodations .
Sharma states that the destruction of a few communications centers or sub - command posts has little affect on the Greater organization .
Approximately 44000 people have died in the insurgency .
Head of the Military - funded Institute of Defense studies and analysis in New Delhi Uday Bhaskar also warned against complacency stating that loss of firepower and manpower is unimportant .
Bhaskar stated that the militants will soon regroup because they are highly motivated and believe they can achieve their goal of freeing Kashmir from Indian control with violence .
The Indian government is also taking a cautious approach .
Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee on 17 October 2005 called for vigilance along the 430 - mile de facto border which divides the two Kashmirs .
Mukherjee stated --
Militants have attempted to infiltrate Indian Kashmir approximately 5 times since 08 October 2005 including twice on a single day .
Some of the militants wanted to take advantage of the unstable situation in the region .
The presence of civilians among the troops on relief work could help militants cross the de facto border .
There could be more infiltration attempts next week before winter snow blocks the mountain passes .

During a 4 - day tour of France Chinese Prime Minister Wen states that French company Areva must improve its offer for a nuclear reactor deal with regard to price and technology transfer .
Wen also signed a deal to initiate student exchange programs and attempted to allay anxiety about China 's rapidly growing power .
On 06 December 2005 Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao stated that in order to win a contract to build third - generation nuclear reactors in China France must improve its offer in terms of both cost and transfers of technology .
Wen was speaking on the 3rd day of a 4 - day visit to France .
On a tour of the elite Polytechnique Science University in the southern suburbs of Paris Wen stated that China hopes France will offer more attractive conditions on technology transfer as well as price so that Franco - Chinese cooperation in this field can develop .
The French company Areva is bidding for an 8 billion U.S. dollar ( 6.8 billion euro ) deal to construct 4 reactors in China as are U.S. company Westinghouse and Russian company atomstroyexport .
The bidding among the 3 companies has been competitive .
China was to have announced a winner by the end of 2005 but has delayed its decision until early next year hoping to elicit better terms from the bidders .
On 05 December 2005 during the 4 - day visit to France a Chinese order for 150 medium - range A 320 airliners from the European consortium Airbus was announced .
Airbus also signed a protocol that could lead to aircraft being constructed in China .
Prime Minister Wen held talks in Paris with French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and French President Jacques Chirac and was then to depart the afternoon of 06 December 2005 to Marseille to visit the headquarters of the helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter .
On 05 December 2005 Eurocopter announced a 600 million Euro partnership deal with China to share development and production of a new 16 - seat aircraft called the ec175 .
Wen is scheduled to visit the site of the future experimental nuclear fusion reactor ITER in which China is a partner .
On 07 December 2005 Wen is scheduled to tour the space - satellite facility of telecommunications company Alcatel in Cannes .
Wen departs on 07 December 2005 for Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Portugal .
1 of the reasons for Wen 's visit to the 200 year - old Polytechnique at palaiseau was to sign a partnership deal with three Chinese universities that will introduce new exchange programs and shared qualifications .
Wen stated --
The dynamic young students represented the future of the world .
Student exchanges are more important than the purchase of 150 Airbus .
At present there is economic cooperation between China and France but with such programs in the future there will be cultural cooperation .
In a speech to students , professors and business leaders , Wen attempted to allay anxiety in Europe that China 's fast - growing economic power is a threat to the rest of the world .
Wen stated that because China suffered so much from foreign invasions it understands the value of peace .
Wen stated that for China to choose peace is logical given its history and culture .
China 's development is not a threat but an opportunity for the world .
The French have expressed fear that China 's low costs and poor standards of social security are attracting economic activity and causing increased unemployment in Europe but Wen argued that growing domestic demand in China will eventually lead to new opportunities for foreign exporters .
France views China as a strategic ally in its pursuit of a multipolar world that is not dominated by the U.S. though trade relations between France and China remain low .
France ranks 15th among suppliers to China providing only 1.4 percent of China 's foreign needs .

China said on February 1 , 2007 it did not want an arms race in space .
China did not comment on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's claims that China 's satellite - destroying test had broken international law .
China 's Foreign Ministry refused to react directly to Abe 's comments that Beijing had violated an International Space Treaty when it shot down one of its own satellites with a missile on January 11 , 2007 .
Spokeswoman Jiang Yu said China had already stated China 's position .
Many other countries are concerned about the peaceful uses of outer space .
The countries oppose the weaponization of space and an arms race in space .
China wants them to make common efforts to realize this goal .
Abe said to the Japanese parliament on January 31 , 2007 that Abe believed China 's test was not in compliance with basic international rules such as the Outer Space Treaty .
The 1967 UN treaty bans weapons of mass destruction in space and said that all nations should avoid contamination of space and be held liable for any damage caused .
The United States is concerned that debris from the Chinese test could damage satellites or the manned international space station .
Jiang Yu said she was not aware of the specific information concerning space debris .
Yu insisted that China would be a force for peace and stability .

China said it had the right to carry out the test after destroying the satellite .
The United States and the then Soviet Union are the only other nations to have carried similar tests .
Both stopped the practice in 1985 partly over concerns about the debris left in space .

Authorizing of EU sanctions against North Korea meets difficulties due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar .
Diplomatic sources said on 070208 that EU sanctions against North Korea can not go forward due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar inhibiting Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary from being listed as one of the required competent authorities .
The European Union decided in 061100 to ban the export of arms and nuclear and missile technology as well as luxury products in compliance with the UN resolution number 1718 adopted after Pyongyang carried out nuclear tests in 061000 .
The EU also introduced restrictions of entry to the EU for individuals deemed to be aiding North Korea 's programs for nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .
Before the measures are applied , the legal sanctions document requires a list of authorities , banks and other bodies in each Member State which would supervise compliance with the sanctions and freeze assets .
British spokeswoman Vicky Courtney in Brussels said Britain insisted that Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary be listed as the competent authority as had done on previous occasions without Spain making any complaint .
Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary acts as the link between the gibraltan government and the British government and Governor .
Another diplomatic source , said the Spanish government was afraid that any mention of a gibraltan authority would constitute a precedent in relations between the EU and Gibraltar and so opposed the move this time .
The Government of Spain insists that Britain should be named in the annex to the document but not Gibraltar .
The Spanish Government refuses to afford any international legitimacy to Gibraltar .
The UK and Spain are seeking to reach a formula which would satisfy both sides .
The 2 EU nations have thus far failed to do so .
Courtney said there is some frustration with the fact that the sanctions are being held up .
Courtney added that it is important to find a constructive solution applicable to this and other documents in future and said that the application of other sanctions also runs the risk of being blocked .
Other EU - levied sanctions include those against Iran over the Iranian nuclear program .
Gibraltar was ceded in perpetuity to Britain by Spain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , however Madrid still claims sovereignty .
Gibraltarians in 020000 overwhelmingly rejected moves by Britain and Spain to move towards joint sovereignty for Gibraltar and Gibraltar 's 30000 inhabitants .

Kadhafi warns that US and Britain 's failure to compensate Libya for nuclear disarmament will deter Iran and North Korea from disarming .
20070302 Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi stated in an interview published on the BBC website --
Britain , the EU and the US have not invested in Libya following the country 's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program .
Western countries ' failure to sufficiently compensate Libya will deter Iran and North Korea from disarming .
Other countries should emulate Libya 's example but the example has been destroyed because the US and Britain did not fulfill their promises .
Kadhafi stated --
Libya may still cooperate with Western countries for mutual benefit .
The lack of foreign support will not cause Libya to return to hostile pursuits .
Kadhafi spoke with the BBC from the 30th anniversary celebration of Libya 's Jamahiriyah ( State of the masses ) political system in Sebha .
In 2003 Kadhafi normalized Libya 's relations with Britain , France and the US by pledging to abandon attempts to develop nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction .
Kadhafi had been widely condemned by the international community in previous decades due to opposition to Western countries and alleged support of terrorism .

Australia 's Foreign Minister warns of continuing terrorist threats despite efforts against militants .
Australia 's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer warned 070305 in opening remarks at a counter - terrorism conference Jakarta that terrorists continue to find new recruits and launch attacks despite the foiling of some plots and the jailing of militants .
Indonesia and Australia are co - hosting a 2 - day meeting in Indonesia 's capital attended by the foreign ministers of Malaysia , Thailand and the Philippines and a senior minister from Singapore .
Downer said terrorists are still at large despite terrorist plots having been foiled , terrorists having been captured and prosecuted and terrorist networks having been disrupted .
Downer said that terrorists ' methods and abilities become more sophisticated even as Governments ' capacity to stop them improves .
Indonesia 's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said terrorists must not be stopped at the expense of democratic principles .
Wirajuda said terrorists must be stopped without resorting to repressive and undemocratic measures like the violation of human rights or disregard of due process of law .
Wirajuda added that terrorists had been evolving new strategies and tactics and thus are becoming an even greater threat to peace , security and progress .
Wirajuda stated there was a need for better ways of denying terrorists access to weapons of mass destruction and that more effective ways of denying the terrorists access to deadly weapons and especially weapons of great killing power must be devised .
Wirajuda said that vigilance and innovative measures were key to an adequate response to the terrorist threat .
Downer hoped the countries at the meeting could agree on cooperation to stop terrorists acquiring unconventional weapons and to improve law enforcement , intelligence sharing and the response to attacks causing mass casualties .
The Jakarta conference follows an earlier counter - terrorism meeting in Bali in 040200 attended by ministers from 20 Southeast Asian and Pacific countries .
A series of terror attacks have hit Indonesia .
The most recent attack was a triple suicide bombing in the resort island Bali in 050000 that killed 20 bystanders .

Peace activists from Greenpeace climbed a crane on the River Thames outside Britain 's houses of parliament and called MPs to campaign against Prime Minister Tony Blair 's plans to renew the UK 's nuclear deterrent .
Peace activists climbed a crane on the River Thames outside Britain 's houses of parliament on 070313 to campaign against Prime Minister Tony Blair 's plans to renew the UK 's nuclear deterrent .
4 protesters from Greenpeace clambered an estimated 200 feet up the maintenance crane moored on the river and unfurled a banner suggesting Blair loved weapons of mass destruction .
Greenpeace said in a statement that the activists scaled the structure at about 6:00 am GMT and were phoning and attempting to persuade members of parliament ( MP ) to vote against the government .
A Greenpeace spokesman said the 4 volunteers aim to occupy the crane until the vote takes place and hope to telephone as many MPs as possible urging rejection of new weapons of mass destruction .
Lawmakers in the UK parliament 's lower House of Commons are to debate and vote on 070314 whether to back Blair 's controversial 38 - billion - dollar plan to replace the US - built Trident missile system .
Nuclear weapons are still a divisive issue in Blair 's governing Labour Party as unilateral nuclear disarmament was once official labour policy in the 800000 .
Many traditionalists accuse Blair of stifling debate on the subject and claim Trident is a costly and obsolete relic of the cold war and is no longer required .
Deputy Leader of the Commons Nigel Griffiths resigned on 070312 so as to be able to vote against Blair 's government and was joined on 070313 by junior health department aide Jim Devine .
A widespread rebellion from rank - and - file Labour lawmakers is widely predicted .
A BBC Radio poll on 070311 said 64 out of the 101 Labour MPs whom were asked expressed opposition to Blair 's plans .
A further 15 Labour MPs were undecided .
22 backed the proposals .
Lobby group the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) on 070313 said 62 Labour MPs and a total of 105 MPs overall had signed an amendment to the vote calling for more time to discuss the issue .
Blair is not expected to lose the vote but will have to rely on the support of the main opposition Conservative Party .
The conservatives broadly back Blair 's plans for a new submarine - based weapons system .

The UN General Assembly on 070315 endorsed UN Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon 's proposal to reform 2 UN core activities peacekeeping and disarmament .
The General Assembly adopted by consensus a restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ( DPKO ) involving a split into 2 separate entities for peacekeeping operations .
A Department of peace operations will be tasked with strategy and day - to - day direction and management .
A separate Department of field support will consolidate the support functions of UN field personnel , procurement and financial management .
France 's Jean - Marie Guehenno is the current head of DPKO and will stay on as chief of the future dpo .
The General Assembly also approved Ban 's plan to establish an Office of Disarmament Affairs ( ODA ) to replace the current Department of Disarmament Affairs .
The Secretary General has dismissed suggestions that turning the Disarmament Department into an office signified de - emphasis and said the office would instead report directly to the UN Secretary - General and would ensure access and more frequent interaction .
Developing countries have criticized the larger Powers on disarmament and specifically for failing to reduce nuclear arsenals while insisting on non - proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction .
Ban announced plans soon after taking office on 070101 to reform the UN 's sprawling peacekeeping operations and tighten control over disarmament matters .
The peacekeeping and disarmament reforms were strongly backed by Western countries and faced initial resistance from developing countries .
This resistance prompted ban to launch a process of consultations with the General Assembly to explain the ideas for reform .

The 15 UN Security Council members met behind closed doors early 070323 to put the finishing touches to a amended text submitted 070322 by the text 's 3 sponsors Britain , France and Germany .
They were to meet again later 070323 to consider an amendment requested by Indonesia and Qatar for insertion of a paragraph into the draft on the goal of establishing a Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery .
Diplomats said the United States was opposed to the inclusion of this paragraph .
The Russian delegation offered compromise language stating that a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue would contribute to global non - proliferation efforts as well as those in the Middle East .
Qatar 's UN ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser said the Security Council would discuss some amendments raised by Qatar , Indonesia and South Africa and expressed hope that a consensus could be reached .

An Indonesian official says Indonesia agreed to further UN sanctions against Iran over the disputed atomic program because the sanctions promote the goal of a nuclear weapons - free Middle East .
Indonesia 's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said on 070326 that Muslim - majority Indonesia agreed to further UN sanctions against Iran over the Iranian government 's disputed atomic program because the sanctions promote the goal of a nuclear weapons - free Middle East .
Wirajuda said the Indonesian government was supporting implementation of a nuclear weapons - free zone in the Middle East and pointed out that Israel is the only country in the Middle East which possesses nuclear weapons .
A clause which emphasized that resolving the Iranian nuclear issue would help to realize the objective of a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction was included in the sanctions resolution at the request of Indonesia and Qatar .
Some commentators have criticized Indonesia for backing the sanctions because such a stance could diminish Indonesia 's standing among Muslim nations .
Wirajuda said the proposition introduced in the UN resolution for a nuclear weapons - free zone in the Middle East is supported by Arabic countries .
The resolution was passed unanimously on 070324 after days of hard bargaining by the Security Council 's 15 members .
Indonesia currently holds one of the Council 's rotating seats .
The sanctions block all Iranian arms exports and freeze the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and restrict financial aid or loans to the Iranian government while setting a new 60 - day deadline for the Iranian government to comply with UN demands or face further appropriate measures .
The Iranian government reacted angrily and expressed intent to restrict cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA in retaliation .

Japan on March 27 , 2007 deployed troops to Nepal to monitor Nepal 's ceasefire .
This was the first military mission since Japan created a full - fledged Defense Ministry .
Officially Japan is a pacifist nation .
A Defense Ministry official said that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's cabinet decided at a meeting to dispatch six soldiers to Nepal to observe arms control for a year .
Japan will help monitor weapons and soldiers under the peace accord that ended Nepal 's decade - long Maoist insurgency .
Nepal is in the Himalayas .
Japan is a major donor to Nepal .
Japan was forced by the United States to renounce its right to armed forces after World War II and has been slowly expanding its military operations overseas .
Japan created a full - fledged Defense Ministry in January 2007 for the first time since 1945 .
Japan upgraded the former defense agency which was lower in rank than cabinet - level ministries .
Abe 's conservative government also listed overseas peacekeeping activities as a mission for Japan 's military because of the change .
They are known as the self - defense forces .
Deployments abroad had been previously considered extraordinary and led the Government to seek parliamentary approval .
Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma told reporters that this is the first time Japan will deploy the Self - Defense Force abroad since peacekeeping became one of the main missions for the troops .
Kyuma said that Japan has to pay careful attention to the security .
Japan sent 600 troops in its most prominent deployment to Iraq on a reconstruction mission .
The soldiers returned last year without suffering any casualties or firing a shot .

The EU froze the assets abroad of some North Korean officials .
The EU banned exports to the country of luxury goods like caviar , truffles , high - quality wines and perfumes and pure bred horses .
The bloc supported UN resolution 1718 in November .

The decision was delayed by an argument between Britain and Spain concerning the method in which Gibraltar would implement the measures .
The resolution was passed after the North Korean government announced that it had performed its first nuclear weapons test on October 9 , 2006 .
The announcement triggered world - wide outrage .

Illegal arms trafficking increases in Kenya due to easy availability and neighboring conflicts .
Government initiatives to disarm have been ineffective .
Illegal arms trafficking has increased in Kenya and raised concern about security .
Daniel kiptugen of Oxfam stated that there are approximately 140,000 illegal arms in circulation in Kenya among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups .
Illegal weapons are easily procured in urban open - air markets despite a government initiative launched in 2006 to curb the availability of arms .
Kenyan security minister John Michuki recently stated at a ceremony burning 8000 illegal arms seized in 2006 to prevent the spread of firearms --
Firearms fuel the illegal exploitation of natural resources and abet terrorism and other crimes .
The easy affordability and accessibility of arms reduces incentives to pursue non - violent solutions to conflicts and initiates a spiral of insecurity .
Police stated that conflicts along Kenya 's borders have increased the number of weapons in the area .
Conflicts include a 20 - year insurgency in Uganda , anarchy in Somalia since 1991 and the former civil war in Sudan .
Police spokesman Gideon kibunjah stated --
Kenya has always experienced serious arms trafficking but the free sale of arms in Somalia presents an additional problem .
Weapons smuggling has increased since 20061200 when Ethiopian - Somali troops eradicated an Islamist movement from south and central Somalia .
Mogadishu experienced chaos and arms control at the border with Kenya became a low - priority issue .
Kenya has participated since 2000 in a regional treaty to control and reduce the number of illegal arms in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa but has achieved limited success in disarmament .
Kiptugen stated --
The impact of government disarmament programs had not yet been apparent .
Forced disarmament process has never been successful because it fails to address the impetus of the demand : competition for natural resources and a lack of government security forces .
Pastoral communities in northern Kenya frequently resolve tribal conflicts concerning water and land access by gun battles .
Communities consider guns a means of self - protection and protection of the community 's livelihood .
Gun Control activist Walter Odhiambo stated that increased economic inequity in Kenya is a catalyst for violence .
2/3 of the population subsists on under 1 dollar per day .
The Kenyan government has increased promises to augment security measures before President Mwai Kibaki contends for re - election in 20071200 .
The US issued a travel advisory to US citizens warning of increasing incidents of violent crime after 2 Americans were shot and killed in Kenya in 20070100 .
Kenya has struggled to overcome a reputation of high crime rates and frequent terrorist threats after the country experienced deadly terrorist attacks in 1998 and 2002 , ongoing tribal conflicts and a crime wave that killed 50 in 20070100 .
Kenya was previously considered relatively stable compared to surrounding countries in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa ridden with regional conflicts .

Thailand 's Defense Ministry has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles .
Jane 's Defence Weekly reported on 070412 that the Thai Government has decided to develop and produce rockets and missiles in a radical shift towards building an indigenous defense industry .
Jane 's said the program would lift Thailand beyond the current capacity for producing explosives , ammunition and small arms under licence as well as modernizing and repairing aircraft and armored vehicles .
The Thai armed forces do not currently have any surface - to - surface missiles in their inventory .
Jane 's cited an internal Thai Defense Ministry document which said Thailand will start by developing a multiple - launch rocket ( MLR ) with a range of 80 kilometers ( 48 miles ) .
Jane 's said there is already a project underway to develop a 160 millimeter MLR with a 40 - kilometer range and that other projects include a strategic rocket with turbojet engine guided by Global Position System and inertial navigation system .
The Thai Ministry document says funding pressures on the defense budget and encouragement by unspecified sectors for greater self - sufficiency is driving the new program .
Such a rocket is significant because of the implication of efforts to develop a surface - to - surface missile with a range at the upper limit of the voluntary Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
The MTCR is a global disarmament group involving the United States and 33 other members and was established in 870000 to control exports of missiles which can deliver weapons of mass destruction .
Thailand 's King bhumipol Adulyadej enjoys strong support from the armed forces which overthrew the Thai government in a bloodless coup in 060900 and has called for a sufficiency economy .
Jane 's added that the new research and development program was launched before the coup but gained formal approval upon submission to the country 's Defense Council about a month afterwards .

Members of Egypt 's opposition Muslim Brotherhood on trial in Egyptian military court including high - ranking businessman thought to fund the Organization .
Defense lawyers boycotted the closed - door session arguing that they had not been made aware of the trial dates .
A judicial source stated that approximately 40 members of Egypt 's opposition movement Muslim Brotherhood went on trial at a military court on 26 April 2007 charged with belonging to a banned organization and funding terrorism .
Defense lawyers boycotted the closed - door session arguing that they had not been made aware of the dates of the Tribunal .
Family members were initially banned from the proceedings but were eventually permitted entrance .
Family members stated that the defendants remained silent during proceedings because their counsel was not present .
Journalists , family members and diplomatic observers have been allowed into the courtroom for past military trials of Islamists .
The courtroom is at a military base in the desert outside Cairo .
The session on 26 April 2007 was approximately 4 hours in duration and was adjourned until 03 June 2007 .
Defendants included Khayrat Al-Shater who ranks number 3 in the hierarchy of the Muslim Brotherhood .
As part of the Government 's repression of Egypt 's largest opposition bloc Al-Shater was arrested in December 2006 following a university demonstration in which masked pro - Brotherhood students staged a military - style parade on the campus of Al-Azhar University in the capital city Cairo .
Al-Shater and other businessmen linked to the group had their assets frozen and were referred to a military court in February 2007 .
The targeting of Al-Shater and other businessmen associated with the movement has been considered an attempt to disable the Organization financially .
Egyptian authorities accuse the movement of seeking to reactivate its underground military wing with the aim of eventually overthrowing the regime .
The Muslin Brotherhood controls a fifth of the seats in Parliament .
The Government of Egypt began using military courts to try members of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamic groups in the 1990s when they were not being convicted by civilian courts .
Under a law passed by Parliament last week the verdicts of military courts can now be appealed .

A conference of the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) will begin on 30 April 2007 in Vienna .
Experts stated the preparatory session can not change the treaty but is expected to focus on problems in fighting proliferation and in getting the 5 original nuclear weapons states to fulfill the NPT commitment to disarm .
A conference on the world 's nuclear non - proliferation treaty ( NPT ) against the spread of nuclear weapons opens on 30 April 2007 in Vienna .
The meeting will take place through 14 May 2007 and is the 1st of a series of Preparatory Committee sessions ahead of the next overall review in 2010 .
The NPT went into effect at the height of the Cold War in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995 .
The NPT has 188 signatory States and is a deal in which nuclear weapons States agree to disarm while nations without the bomb agree not to seek the bomb .
The NPT is reviewed every 5 years .
The meeting in May 2005 failed to resolve any key questions due to an agenda disagreement between non - aligned countries and nuclear powers .
The NPT Conference occurs as --
The crisis over Iran 's atomic program escalates though Iran has not yet produced atomic bombs .
A deal to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear program which has produced atomic bombs has stalled .
A U.S. strategy to use pre - emptive force if judged necessary and Britian 's nuclear arsenal upgrade threaten the NPT .
Experts stated the NPT is ill adapted to the modern era in which so - called rogue States seek to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity by 1st developing peaceful programs under the terms of the treaty .
Experts stated that fixes should include tougher UN inspections and automatic penalties for countries who drop out of the treaty .
The North Korean government withdrew from the NPT in 2003 after expelling United Nations inspectors .
The North Korean government tested an atomic bomb in October 2006 .
The Iranian government justifies nuclear work under article IV of the NPT which guarantees the inalienable right to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
U.S. government stated that the Iranian government uses article IV as a cover for the secret development of nuclear weapons which the Treaty bans .
Non - proliferation analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington George perkovich stated the NPT is the most effective treaty in history and referred to the fact that predictions made in the 1960s that there would soon be 30-40 nuclear weapons States have not come to pass .
There are believed to be 9 nuclear weapons states .
The States are the 5 allowed under the NPT , Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States .
The States also include North Korea which withdrew from the treaty and 3 nuclear states including India , Pakistan and Israel which have refused to sign the NPT .
Diplomats and experts stated the preparatory session can not change the treaty but is expected to focus on problems in fighting proliferation and in getting the 5 original nuclear weapons states to fulfill the NPT commitment to disarm which is a focus of non - aligned States .
Nuclear and disarmement expert Rebecca Johnson wrote the week of 22 April 2007 on Johnson 's Acronym Institute website that the risk of nuclear proliferation is too grave for the international community to shirk responsibilities and that the NPT has already begun to unravel .
Felicity Hill of the non - governmental organization the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons ( ican ) stated to AFP that the meeting could build towards a successful 2010 Review Conference but progress must occur on both non - proliferation and disarmament .
A diplomat in Vienna who closely follows the non - proliferation regime stated that expectations are being lowered for a successful outcome to the Preparatory Committee given the inauspicious international developments and the growing detritus of arms control agreements cast aside .

On 21 May 2007 the Government of Estonia rejected European Union criticism of its handling of recent cyber attacks .
Estonia has experienced a series of cyber attacks since the end of April 2007 that have forced it to restrict access to many State websites .
Estonia is a Baltic State member of the European Union .
Hillar aarelaid is head of Estonia 's computer emergency response team cert .
Aarelaid was responding to comments made by Jacqueline McGlade .
McGlade is head of the EU agency that promotes a shared network of environmental data .
Aarelaid stated that McGlade 's assertion that Estonia should have employed basic procedures such as firewalls to defend from cyber attack demonstrated ignorance of the extent of the cyber assaults on Estonia .
Aarelaid stated to the AFP by phone on 21 May 2007 that if the solution had been as simple as using elementary firewalls that Estonia would have done it .
At a press conference in Geneva McGlade had stated that the EU agency she heads firmly believes that to react to cyber attack by closing systems down is unsound .
Estonia began barring access to key government and some private websites 3 weeks ago after the onset of a series of cyber attacks against Estonia .
Many of the attacks originated abroad .
The cyber attacks were triggered by Estonian government authorities ' decision to remove a Soviet war memorial from central Tallinn .
This decision angered Russia and the large ethnic Russian minority in Estonia .
Officials in Estonia including Prime Minister andrus Ansip have claimed that some of the cyber attacks came from Russian government computers including computers in the office of Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Aarelaid stated to AFP --
Critics of Estonia 's response may not be aware that traffic on some Estonian sites was increased by 1 million .
Imposing temporary restrictions on Internet traffic from abroad was inevitable .
Mcglade 's comments on the Estonian response were made in Geneva ahead of a United Nations conference on global access to information technology .
Mcglade stated that attacks on State and private websites should be handled in a systematic way instead of by restricting access .
Mcglade stated that there are technologies that the EU agency deploys in an effort to avoid restricting access to government websites .
The EU Agency will be in contact with the Estonian Government to advise on possible defense measures .
Estonia is a world pioneer in IT solutions .
Estonia ranks higher than the 15 older EU members and just behind the United States on a World Bank list of countries that are advanced in preparing for a knowledge - based society .
Aarelaid stated --
Access to critical websites was never restricted .
Estonia is prepared to keep critical websites accessible in any situation but that during a massive cyber attack some websites like that of the Estonian Agriculture Ministry are of a lower priority to keep accessible to visitors from abroad .

Republic of Korea launches its first Aegis destroyer equipped with advanced air and sea defenses .
Japanese and Chinese naval buildups and the threat from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea have caused Republic of Korea to expand its defense and combat capabilities .
On 25 May 2007 the Republic of Korea launched its first Aegis destroyer equipped with advanced air and sea defenses .
The Republic of Korea faces Japanese and Chinese naval buildups and a potential threat from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .
The KDX - III destroyer weighs 7600 tons .
The navy stated that the Republic of Korea is the 5th country to have a destroyer equipped with the Aegis integrated weapons control system following the United States , Japan , Spain and Norway .
The destroyer was built domestically at a cost of 1 billion U.S. dollars .
President Roh Moo - hyun stated at a launching ceremony that the ship is armed with a state - of - the - art defense system and combat capability and is one of the world 's best destroyers .
Roh stated that Republic of Korea will move forward with a program to create an ocean - going navy .
The destroyer is named the King Sejong after the monarch who helped create the Korean alphabet in the 15th century .
The navy said in a statement --
The King Sejong has integrated capabilities in broad - range air defense , support for ground operations , automatic tracking and destruction of enemy aircraft and guided and ballistic missiles .
The new destroyer is expected to greatly increase combat capabilities .
A 2nd Aegis destroyer will be launched in 2010 and a 3rd in 2012 in what a navy spokesman stated in May 2007 was an attempt to rival the naval powers of Japan and China .
The Republic of Korea faces a potential threat from the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea around their contested maritime border in the Yellow Sea .
This week the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea accused the Republic of Korea of dispatching warships to violate its territorial waters .
6 South Koreans were killed in June 2002 in battles in the area .
In June 1999 dozens of North Korean sailors were killed in a similar battle .
The Aegis combat system was built by the U.S. firm Lockheed Martin .
The Aegis combat system allows a ship to combat multiple surface , underwater and aerial targets .
The King Sejong is also equipped with locally developed ship - to - ship missiles and torpedoes as well as various ship - to - air missiles and ship - to - surface cruise missiles .
Stealth technology was used in building the King Sejong making radar detection more difficult .
The ship will be deployed operationally in 2009 .
The Republic of Korea is cooperating with Germany to build 1800 - ton modern submarines .
A second such submarine will be launched in early June 2007 .

Russia tests new multiple warhead missile capable of penetrating air - defense systems such as the U.S. shield planned for deployment in central Europe .
In response to U.S. plans Putin states that Russia will suspend its compliance with a European conventional weapons control treaty as Russia continues working to regain military parity with the U.S. .
On 29 May 2007 Russia stated it had successfully tested a new multiple warhead ballistic missile designed to overcome air - defense systems such as the U.S. shield planned for deployment in Central Europe .
Russia 's strategic missile forces issued a statement saying that the RS - 24 rocket was fired from the northeastern Arkhangelsk region and hit its target on the Kamchatka Peninsula 6000 kilometers away .
The Kamchatka peninsula protrudes into the Pacific Ocean .
According to the statement the RS - 24 reinforces the military potential of the strategic forces to overcome anti - missile defense systems .
The test occurred amidst Russia 's diplomatic battle over U.S. plans to expand a missile defense shield into Central Europe .
The Russian Government considers the U.S. plan an attempt to gain nuclear power in the region .
First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov is a former defense minister and widely considered a potential successor to President Vladimir Putin in 2008 .
Ivanov stated that the RS - 24 could overcome any anti - missile system like that of the United States .
Ivanov was quoted by Interfax as stating that the Russian missile complexes are capable of penetrating all existing and prospective anti - missile systems .
Ivanov stated that Russians should be confident in the nation 's defense and security capabilities .
The United States states that the planned radar base in the Czech Republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighboring Poland would defend Europe against potential threats from Iran and North Korea and pose no threat to Russia .
President Vladimir Putin disagrees and stated that Russia is suspending compliance with a European conventional weapons control treaty .
Putin warned that a new arms race is possible .
According to the statement the new rocket meets the standards of START - II missile treaties which impose restrictions on the use of multiple warhead missiles .
A spokesman for the strategic forces stated to the AFP that the missile is new but uses technologies of the Topol - M missile .
According to the statement the prototype RS - 24 rocket is unlike the Topol - M in that it is equipped with multiple independently targetable warheads to overwhelm defense systems .
The Ministry of Defense refused to reveal the characteristics of the new missile other than stating it was designed to replace the Soviet - era RS - 18 and RS - 20 rockets .
Director of the Moscow Center for Defense Information Ivan safranchuk stated --
The RS - 24 is a significant modernization of Topol - M.
The principle advantage is that the RS - 24 is a Russian rocket .
Other multiple warhead missiles that Russia utilized were built in Ukraine .
Prior to the RS - 24 there were no Russian - built multiple warhead missiles .
Military analyst Alexander golts stated that the test was part of a massive effort by the Russian government to regain parity with the United States ' strategic missile forces .
Golts stated that the principle military political aim of the current Russian leadership is to regain parity with the United States .

NATO member States and countries from the former Soviet bloc met in Vienna on 12 June 2007 to re - examine the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe ( CFE ) in light of tensions between Moscow and the West .
The CFE meeting was convened at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and will last until 15 June 2007 .
The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe was signed in Paris in 1990 and aimed at establishing defense parity in Europe .
The CFE came into force in 1992 and limits deployments of tanks and troops in countries belonging to NATO and the former Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe .
Chief of the Russian delegation Anatoly Antonov stated in Vienna on 11 June 2007 that Russian officials called the meeting because the Russian Government is unable to freely move Russian troops on Russian territory .
Anotov referred to limitations imposed by the CFE and stated that the choice of which armed forces to deploy belongs to Russian officials .
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently threatened to suspend application of the CFE amid disagreement with the government in Washington over US plans to extend a missile shield into Central Europe .
Russian and U.S. officials have disagreed over the CFE since 1999 with NATO officials stating that Russian officials have failed to honor commitments to withdraw troops from Moldova and Georgia .
Russian officials accuse the United States of a military buildup near Russia 's borders with the US planning new army bases in Romania and Bulgaria as well as the missile shield proposal .
Antonov stated that Russian officials have serious concerns over the plans for military bases .
On 26 April 2007 Putin cited NATO 's lack of movement and called for a freeze on Russian compliance with the CFE which disconcerted Western observers .
Antonov downplayed the idea that Russian officials would pull out of the CFE altogether and stated that the dispute over the US missile shield would not be discussed at the meeting .
Antonov stated that the US plans for military bases in Romania and Bulgaria will be on the meeting 's agenda .
Antonov rejected an offer made by the US and NATO allies to the Russian Government the week of 3 June 2007 to accept a multinational peacekeeping force in the pro - Russian Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestr .

The United Nations said on June 25 , 2007 that sophisticated laboratories inside Afghanistan are converting 90 percent of Afghanistan 's opium into heroin and morphine before smuggling it around the world .
The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) said Afghanistan is the world 's biggest producer of opium and had exported the illicit drug almost exclusively in its raw form until 2 years ago .
UNODC representative Christina Oguz in Kabul said that she believes the amount of the opium being processed in Afghanistan is approximately 90 percent .
Oguz said that anyone flying over the major opium producing areas would see a lot of small fires in the mountains , which are heroin labs .
Oguz stated that a couple of years ago opium was the primary drug being trafficked out of Afghanistan .
Oguz said there has been an increase of opium being processed into morphine and into heroin and that this indicates sophistication that was not previously present in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan accounts for 92 percent of the world 's heroin supply despite vast internationally - backed efforts to eradicate its opium poppy fields .
Oguz said the annual income from the drugs trade helps finance the Taliban - led insurgency plaguing mainly southern and eastern Afghanistan and that this income totals more than three billion US dollars .
Oguz stated that the drugs have to be fought together with the insurgency .
Afghanistan produced a record 6000 tons of opium in 2006 .
Officials said that the 2007 harvest could exceed the 2006 record because of an increase in opium cultivation in the southern provinces .
Oguz said that favorable weather conditions had also contributed to the increase .
Oguz fears that Afghanistan will have at least the same amount as the 2006 harvest if not more .
Oguz also downplayed international efforts to eradicate poppy crops and said that it was more important to provide poor opium farmers with alternative livelihoods .

Russia 's government announced withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe arms control treaty in hopes that the accompanying uncertainty will pressure European regarding various military , economic , and political issues .
The Russian government announced on 070714 suspension of Russian adherence to the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) arms control treaty .
The CFE is a key agreement that limits the deployment of forces in central and eastern Europe .
US moves to install anti - missile bases in the region were seen as a key cause of the decision .
Analysts said that it is Europe that is likely to suffer most from the decision 's consequences .
Independent defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said the CFE Treaty is much more important to the European countries than the US .
Felgenhauer pointed out that Russia has other problems with Europe and that this withdrawal is another factor reducing confidence and deteriorating relations especially with European countries .
Felgenhauer predicted that actual troop deployments are unlikely to change much and believed the biggest practical effect of Russia 's decision will be an end to mutual inspections and confidence - building measures governed by the Treaty .
Analysts said the hope in the Russian Government is that the uncertainty will weaken European resolve over a number of issues .
Interfax news agency cited Ivan safranchuk of the international center on defense information as saying that the situation will push Europe into a more active position on missile defense .
Europe has largely backed US plans for an anti - missile radar station in the Czech Republic and interceptor rockets in Poland .
The Russian government says the US plans threaten to upset the balance of power on the continent .
Other analysts were doubtful that attempts to pressure the EU would bear fruit .
Editor of the Moscow - based Journal Russia in global affairs Fyodor Lukyanov said the Russian government is hoping that Europe 's extreme unease over this will lead to a softening of Europe 's positions .
Lukyanov thinks the Russian government 's calculations are wrong and that a frightened Europe will join with the United States .
Lukyanov said the decision to freeze the CFE was part of a wider move by the Russian government to use newly found strength to remold the foundations of transatlantic relations and that the Russian government wants to revise the forces influencing interaction in the Euro - Atlantic area that were set when Russia was weaker .
Political analyst and director of Moscow 's Institute for globalization Boris Kagarlitsky said the Russian government also appears to be using its geopolitical strength to put pressure on Europe over business ties .
Kagarlitsky said the withdrawal from the Treaty will be seen in the West as an attempt to put pressure on a number of issues including in the economic sphere .
Disagreements over energy security and a dispute over deliveries of Polish meat have prevented Russian and European Union authorities from agreeing to a new mutual cooperation agreement .
Kagarlitsky said that at some stage the Russian government will put all of the economic issues on the table while expressing doubt whether the Russian government 's goals will be achieved .

In a state of the nation speech in 20070400 Putin stated that Russia should announce a moratorium on adherence to the CFE Treaty until all NATO countries have ratified the Treaty .
Putin appears to particularly target the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , former Soviet republics and current NATO members which are not part of the CFE Treaty .
The CFE Treaty limits the deployment of tanks and troops in NATO and former Eastern European Warsaw Pact countries and establishes confidence - building , transparency and cooperation measures between Member States .

The treaty was adapted in Istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in order to limit deployments on a country - by - country basis .
The CFE is considered a key European post - Cold War security accord .
NATO states have refused to ratify the new pact because Russia has failed to honor commitments made in Istanbul adaptation to withdraw forces from the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Moldova .

Saferworld Team Leader on transfer controls and small arms Roy isbister stated --
The EU embargo prohibits direct or indirect supply of military equipment for use in Myanmar .
The integrity of the arms embargo depends on its implementation and enforcement .

France was criticized over France 's plans to build a nuclear reactor in Libya while nuclear proliferation experts dismissed concerns .
On 070726 France was criticized over France 's plans to build a nuclear reactor in Libya .
Nuclear proliferation experts dismissed concerns that the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal was tantamount to handing Moamer Kadhafi a nuclear bomb .
An official with France 's Atomic Energy Commission insisted that international safeguards imposed after Libya dissolved the Libyan military nuclear program would prevent any Libyan nuclear proliferation .
Other experts agreed with the with French Atomic Energy Commission official .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that the official reason for the Libyan nuclear reactor was a deception as the civilian and military uses of nuclear technology were indissociable .
The official reason for the Libyan nuclear reactor is to desalinate sea water .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that delivering civilian nuclear energy to Libya would amount to eventually helping Libya to acquire nuclear weapons .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that Libya is rich in oil and gas and Libya is very amply self - sufficient in energy .
Sortir du nucleaire stated that if Libya wishes to diversify Libyan power production than Libya should logically give priority to solar energy because Libya enjoys remarkable levels of sunshine all year long .
A memorandum on building the new nuclear reactor in Libya was signed as French president Nicolas Sarkozy held talks with Libyan leader Muammar Kadhafi on 070725 .
On 070724 the Libyan government freed 6 foreign medics after France and European Union officials had played a key role in the process of securing the release of the 6 foreign medics .
Greenpeace France stated that the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation and branded the French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal as in keeping with the French policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology .
Greenpeace pointed out that previous French Presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former Shah of Iran , with the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and with South Africa during the apartheid era .
Frederic marillier stated that the official reason the nuclear reactor is being sold to Libya is to desalinate sea water to improve Libya 's supplies of drinking water .
Frederic marillier stated that Frederic marillier wanted to know who Iran and France thought would believe this reason for building the nuclear reactor .
Frederic marillier is in charge of Greenpeace 's energy campaign .
The French opposition Socialist Party asked if it was not a bit soon to be throwing France into Kadhafi 's arms and giving him France 's international endorsement ?
The French opposition Socialist Party stated that civilian nuclear technology can be used eventually to develop military applications .
The French Green party accused Nicolas Sarkozy of boundless cynicism rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an undemocratic state .
Simon Nisan stated that the 070726 French - Libyan nuclear reactor deal followed the signature in 060300 of a agreement for bilateral cooperation in nuclear research and technology .
Simon Nisan is a member of France 's Atomic Energy Commission and is in charge of nuclear - powered desalination projects .
The 060300 of a agreement for bilateral cooperation focuses primarily on a nuclear research centre at Tajura whose nuclear reactor was supplied by the Soviet Union in 790000 .
Tajura is near Tripoli .
Simon Nisan stated that International Atomic Energy Agency controls made it almost impossible to divert the nuclear technology to military use .
Simon Nisan stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency controls are so tight that a person does not have the right to remove fuel without the presence of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors .
Simon Nisan stated that the material generated is low - enriched uranium and not highly - enriched uranium which is needed for nuclear bombs .
In 040000 weapons - grade uranium stored at the nuclear research centre in Tajura was removed under International Atomic Energy Agency scrutiny and was sent for recycling to Russia after Muammar Kadhafi pledged to give up weapons of mass destruction in 030000 .
Russia had originally supplied the uranium to Iran .
A diplomat in Vienna that is close with the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that the Libyan Government had had very good cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency since 030000 .
Mark Fitzpatrick in London stated that mark Fitzpatrick saw no proliferation risk for the plans to build a nuclear reactor in Libya because of the fact that Libya is still cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency and based on the manner in which Libya turned over and destroyed equipments .
Mark Fitzpatrick is a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies .
Mark Fitzpatrick stated that Libya 's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency , the Government of the United Kingdom and the United States Government has been exemplary .
Mark Fitzpatrick stated that it is important for the rest of the world to see that when a country abandons nuclear weapons programs and weapons of mass destruction that there are tangible benefits .
Mark Fitzpatrick stated that this cooperation with France is a direct result of Libya abandoning nuclear weapons programs and weapons of mass destruction .

British newspapers have reported that Chinese military has hacked into British government networks .
China 's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu denies the Chinese Government 's involvement and stated the Chinese government 's willingness to cooperate with the international community during investigations into the hacking attacks .
China 's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu stated on 6 September 2007 that statements that the Chinese military has made cyber attacks on the networks of foreign Governments are groundless and irresponsible and are a result of ulterior motives .
Jiang stated that the Chinese government has opposed and prohibited any cyber crimes and has explicit laws and regulations regarding cyber crimes .
Jiang stated the Chinese government was willing to cooperate with the international community to investigate the alleged attacks but Chinese police have not received any requests from relevant countries on cooperative investigations .
Jiang 's statement responded to news reports carried by The Times and The Independent newspapers in London that Chinese computer hackers had infiltrated British government networks .
The Times quoted an unidentified British government source as stating that the Chinese government was engaged in hostile intelligence activities .
The source stated the Chinese government is focusing on electronic means to hack into systems to discover Britain 's defense and foreign policy secrets instead of using the old - fashioned methods and that the Chinese government is technologically advanced and adept at hacking .
The reports were issued after US President George W. Bush stated that a discussion of the issue of suspected Chinese cyber - attacks on the US Defense Department could occur during a meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Sydney on 6 September 2007 .
The Pentagon stated on 4 September 2007 that several nations and groups had been trying to break into the US military 's computer system after the Financial Times reported China 's military had successfully hacked into the network in June 2007 .
On 4 September 2007 Jiang denied the hacking allegation .

The OSCE 's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) defended the decision to boycott citing Russian authorities ' delays in issuing visas and unwarranted restrictions imposed on the OSCE observation mission .
On 26 November 2007 Putin stated that the OSCE had canceled its planned vote monitoring on the recommendation of the U.S. State Department and that the aim is to discredit the elections .
Russia has denied obstructing the observers and has stated the elections will conform with Russian law .
Kazakhstan 's bid to assume the rotating chairmanship of the OSCE in 2009 is expected to be a major topic of discussion at the conference .
Kazakhstan 's bid for the OSCE chairmanship is the first bid from a former Soviet Union nation .
The Government of Kazakhstan has lobbied for the chairmanship arguing it has a stable political situation , multilateral foreign policy and strong economy distinguishing it from other former Soviet countries .
Several OSCE member States have questioned Kazakhstan 's democratic credentials .
Kazakhstan is an oil - rich country .
Head of the Assessment Risks Group in Kazakhstan 's capital Almaty is Dosym Satpayev .
Satpayev stated that Kazakhstan 's chances of winning its bid for the chairmanship were considerably reduced after its last general elections were not recognized as conforming to OSCE standards .
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev 's political party Nur Otan won all the seats in the parliamentary election held in August 2007 .
The choice of the OSCE chairmanship is made by consensus .
Opposition by 1 country would be enough to deny Kazakhstan the chairmanship .
British newspaper The Financial Times reported on 27 November 2007 that OSCE officials will offer Kazakhstan a deal organized by Spain under which the country would assume the rotating chairmanship in 2010 or 2011 .
OSCE spokeswoman Virginie coulloudon stated that such a deal is 1 scenario among 5 or 6 others .
Kazakhstan 's Foreign Ministry insists the country is still seeking the chairmanship for 2009 .

US experts report Chinese plans to dispatch troops to North Korea and secure North Korea 's nuclear arsenal in the event of instability .
A report compiled by experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies , the US Institute of Peace and the Asia Foundation stated that China has contingency plans to dispatch Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) troops to North Korea and secure nuclear weapons in the event of instability in North Korea .
The experts visited China 20070600 to confer with Chinese military researchers .
The report stated --
China 's strong preference is to receive formal authorization and coordinate closely with the UN in any possible intervention .
China would take unilateral action to restore stability if the international community did not react in a timely manner as the internal order in North Korea deteriorated rapidly .
The report stated --
PLA researchers claim that contingency plans exist for the PLA to perform three possible missions in North Korea -- humanitarian , peacekeeping and environmental control .
The environmental control measures are intended to clean up nuclear contamination resulting from a strike on North Korean nuclear facilities near the Sino - North Korean border and to secure nuclear weapons and fissile materials .
The report stated --
China 's main priority in the event of instability in North Korea would be prevention of an influx of refugees by assuring supplies of food and strengthening border controls .

Non - nuclear countries will be difficult to mobilize against Iran if they are treated the same way as Iran .
Some are concerned over the potential risk of supplying nuclear technology to Arab States because the region is unstable and dominated by authoritarian regimes and Islamic extremism .
German energy minister Gernot Erler stated in response to France 's decision to provide nuclear technology to Libya that the risk of proliferation goes up with every country that uses nuclear energy .
French environmentalists stated that Sarkozy is not sufficiently addressing concerns about human rights , the environment and international security .

Iran is suspected of concealing military ambitions of its clandestine nuclear programs and is subject to international sanctions due to refusing to comply with UN demands .

The Government accepts that there were defective aspects of the trials in which the life or health of participants may have been endangered .
The trials were frequently under considerable pressures of time as new threats emerged .
The Government acknowledges the debt Britain owes to the victims of the trials .
The veterans claim to have been informed that they were volunteering for cold remedy tests and have suffered ill - health as a result .
The trials occurred at the government 's military chemical and biological defense research facility at Porton Down in southwest England in the 1950s and 1960s .

UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .
Drug production will be a main focus of a meeting in Tokyo to assess progress in Afghanistan .
UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .
Oguz stated to AFP in an interview that the drug industry in Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world 's illegal opium and that ending the industry in Afghanistan will take decades .
Drug production escalated in 2007 and furthers deteriorating security .
Drug production will be a main focus of ministers , donors and aid agencies meeting in Tokyo on 5 February 2008 through 6 February 2008 to assess progress in Afghanistan .
A paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to afghanistan 's stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities .
The source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board ( jcmb ) which is a committee working to implement Afghanistan 's 5 - year reconstruction plan .
The paper said the drug trade funds terrorism , fuels corruption and undermines the rule of law that should bring security to the people of Afghanistan .
The paper said traffickers provide weapons , funding and personnel to anti - government rebels while corrupt officials offer protection of drug trade routes , poppy fields and people .
6 , Oguz stated a focus of the Tokyo talks will be the need for immediate action in lieu of talking .
Oguz stated --
The fact that President Hamid Karzai has not appointed a counternarcotics minister to replace the minister who resigned in July 2008 indicates the priority given to drug production even though Karzai has said drug production is 1 of the most important issues for Afghanistan to tackle .
Very little has been done to fight corruption .
Corruption feeds the industry in that farmers often have to pay a 10 percent tax to Afghan officials or Taliban insurgents .
Farmers must pay various bribes .
Farmers receive less than 1/4 of the 4 billion dollars that annual trade earns which is equal to more than 1/2 of the legal gross domestic product .
No one questions how people have very low salaries but drive in expensive cars and live in expensive houses .
Typically only the couriers are arrested .
Oguz stated bigger criminals are extremely difficult to find .
Some are not living in Afghanistan despite being Afghans .
Afghanistan 's opium is increasingly converted into heroin inside Afghanistan and supplies drug users in Europe , Central Asia and the Middle East .
Oguz stated blaming Afghanistan for the world 's heroin problem would be unfair as heroin production is a shared responsibility .
Chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin come primarily from the developed world and are illegally sent to Afghanistan .
Oguz stated the national strategy to deal with the drugs trade should be tailored to the different circumstances in the 34 provinces .
13 provinces were declared opium - free in 2007 which is double the figure from 2006 .
Oguz stated --
The focus should be on interdiction in southern Afghanistan because of the common interest between insurgents and drug traffickers to keep the south out of reach from the government in Kabul and the international aid community .
The north and center of Afghanistan have more order and government structure and should be offered incentives like development to persuade farmers and other players to cease opium production .
Oguz stated the necessity of a long - term effort to combat the drug problem with Afghanistan rebuilding from below - scratch .
Oguz stated the drug trade links into corruption and the insurgency and will not be an easy task to combat .
Oguz stated combating the drug trade in Thailand took 20 years even though Thailand had some functioning institutions .

Terrorism analyst and head of the Singapore - based International Centre for political violence and terrorism research Rohan Gunaratna stated the Consortium seeks to make the transfer of money difficult for extremist groups .
Gunaratna spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a closed - door Seminar on countering the financing of terrorism and stated militant groups including the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) move between 2 and 3 million US dollars per month to fund terrorist activities in Southeast Asia .
Gunaratna stated the estimate was based on data gathered from the debriefing of captured militants , examination of documents seized from militant training camps and from intelligence reports .
Gunaratna stated groups involved in the fund transfers include the Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which both operate in the southern Philippines as well as the Southeast Asia - based JI and groups in southern Thailand and Indonesia .
Authorities blamed JI for bombings which killed mostly foreigners among 202 people on the Indonesian resort island of Bali in 2002 and a series of other attacks .
Gunaratna stated militant groups use the banking system , informal money transfers and couriers carrying bags filled with cash to transfer the funds .
Gunaratna stated a portion of the money is raised in Southeast Asia while some comes from the Middle East and other countries .

IAEA meets in Vienna to discuss Iran issue .
20080303 deputy head of the country 's atomic energy organization Mohammad Saeedi stated --
A new UN Security Council resolution against Iran 's nuclear activities would be irrational and unlawful and complicate the standoff with Western nations rather than promoting resolution of the issue .
The path of the Security Council and any new resolution lacks legal credibility .
Supporters should be held accountable for their illegal act .

Diplomats stated --
Depending on the outcome of the Security Council vote , the IAEA board is considering tabling a separate resolution demanding that Iran reveal its disputed nuclear activities .

The IAEA board has not made a resolution in 2 years .
US envoy to the IAEA Gregory Schulte stated to reporters prior to the meeting --
Despite limited progress in addressing past issues , troubling questions remain about Iranian activities that strongly suggest a clandestine weapons - related program .
The Board is likely to support the Security Council 's call for Iran to suspend its enrichment - related activities
Indications of weapons work constituting a violation of NPT obligations and Iran 's violation of Security Council resolutions provide strong reason for the Security Council and the IAEA to continue to investigate Iran .
ElBaradei 's latest report stated --
Iran addressed the majority of outstanding questions about its past nuclear program but refused to address allegations about its purported nuclear weapons work .
Iran is pursuing and expanding uranium enrichment in flagrant violation of UN demands .

Possibility of a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given impetus as British prime minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military .
Hopes for a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given a boost on 080522 when British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military .
The statement from Brown 's spokesman gave new impetus to ongoing negotiations at an international conference on cluster bombs in Dublin .
Brown 's spokesman said Brown had issued instructions to British negotiators in Dublin to work intensively to ban cluster bombs that cause unacceptable harm to civilians .
A British government spokesman said Brown had also asked the Ministry of Defence to assess the remaining munitions in use to ensure that there was no risk to civilians .
The new stance by the British government received a warm welcome from human rights activists and charities .
Head of arms control for Oxfam Anna MacDonald said Britain has at last come in from the cold .
Oxfam hopes that this strong statement from Brown will ensure that the UK signs onto the treaty and immediately gets rid of these weapons which maim and kill long after they have been dropped .
Co - Chair of the cluster munition coalition and Director of Landmine Action Simon Conway expressed gladness that Brown is following up on his previous public commitment to ban cluster bombs .
The Dublin Conference runs until May 30 and is aiming to strike a wide - ranging international agreement that would completely eradicate the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions among signatories .
The United States Government on 080521 expressed opposition to a worldwide ban on cluster bombs and called instead for technological fixes that would make them safer .
Cluster bombs were first used in World War II and open in the air and scatter smaller bombs over a wide area .
The fact that many fail to detonate on impact have made them a risk to the lives of civilians for years .
The British military currently possesses 2 Types of cluster ammunition which are the artillery - fired m85 and the m73 launched from helicopters .
Campaigners claim British troops used the m85 bombs in the Iraq war in 030000 .

Amnesty International reports on light weapons impact and urges global arms treaty preventing weapons sales to human rights violators .
20080917 in the report ' blood at the crossroads ' Amnesty International stated that a new UN global arms treaty under negotiation should require Governments to actively prevent sales of weapons likely to be used in humans rights violations .
The report stated that the system of national laws regulating arms sales is ineffective and enables Unrestrained Weapons trading leading to violations of human rights .
153 countries voted for a UN motion to introduce a global arms treaty in 20061200 and UN member states will discuss progress on the Treaty in 20081000 .
Amnesty International stated that the US -- which rejected the arms treaty motion -- China , Egypt , India , Pakistan and Russia are stalling the treaty .
Amnesty arms control manager Brian Wood stated that a minority of skeptics preferring to ignore irresponsible arms transfers defy the majority of the international community 's approval of arms control and render most national arms controls and UN arms embargoes weak and ineffective .
The report catalogues the impact of light weapons in 9 countries .
The report states that small weapons were used with catastrophic effects by the Myanmar military to disperse protestors in 20070900 and Somalian armed factions in Mogadishu .
The report also profiles Darfur , Colombia , Guatemala , Guinea and especially Iraq .
The report stated --
The US Department of Defense has funded the majority of over 1 million rifles , pistols and infantry weapons for 530000 Iraqi security personnel since 2003 .
The funding process was mismanaged and unaccountable because the contracting out of the weapons deals rendered accurate documentation of supplies and recipients by people authorizing weapons and munitions transfers virtually impossible .
The mismanagement has augmented sectarian violence in Iraq since the 2003 US - led invasion .
Researcher Helen Hughes stated that Governments must meet their obligation through an arms trade treaty with a stipulation on human rights rather than ignoring the consequences of irresponsible international arms transfers .

The leaders of Australia and Japan launched a Commission on September 26 , 2008 to press for nuclear Non Proliferation and Disarmament ahead of review of a key international atomic treaty .
The International Commission on nuclear non - proliferation and disarmament was unveiled by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and new Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly .
The Panel is led by former Australian and Japanese foreign ministers Gareth Evans and Yoriko Kawaguchi respectively and has 15 - members .
It is comprised of former heads of State , ministers , military strategists and disarmament experts .
Rudd said it will seek to shape a global consensus in the lead up to the 2010 nuclear Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) Review Conference and beyond .
Rudd said the NPT is facing increased pressure from the actions of countries such as North Korea and Iran even though NPT is the most significant and successful arms control instrument of the nuclear age and the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts .
Iran has been accused of carrying out an illegal nuclear program while North Korea has defiantly moved to restart its illicit nuclear activities after stopping them .
Aso said Japan has always undertaken a realistic and concrete approach towards realizing a nuclear weapons free world because it is the only country that experienced the bombing of a nuclear weapon .
Aso assumed the premiership this week .
Aso told the Commission to hold active discussions and prepare meaningful recommendations for a more effective non - proliferation and disarmament regime .
A statement said the implications of a likely nuclear renaissance due to climate change and energy security concerns will be a focus of the Commission .
This includes the need for renewed attention to nuclear safeguards , safety and security .
The first meeting of the Commission will be held in Sydney from October 19 to 21 .
It will be hosted by the Australian Government .
Among those in the Commission are former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland , former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo , former US Defense Secretary William Perry , ex - Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas , China 's ex - UN envoy Wang Yingfan .

Archbishop Desmond Tutu makes appeal at UN for member states to support a global arms trade treaty to stop the casualties worldwide which result from the uncontrolled small arms trade .
South Africa 's retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu on 081021 appealed to UN member states to end the casualties which result from the uncontrolled small arms trade by backing a global arms trade treaty .
Tutu 's appeal came as the UN Disarmament Committee is set to vote on an arms trade treaty ( Att ) resolution next week .
Some 85 countries are co - sponsoring the text .
Tutu pointed out in a message delivered to all 192 missions at the United Nations in New York that in the last 2 years almost 0.75 million people have died as a result of armed violence .
Tutu said each Member State can and must act to control the deadly trade in weapons that is behind these deaths .
Tutu said there can be no further delay and that is time to end the slaughter .
Tutu said there are some States which are opposed to such a treaty and will seek to undermine and delay any further progress or will seek to convince others that this Treaty is not required or can not work .
Tutu said these States must not be allowed to succeed because the human cost is too high .
Tutu 's message was delivered by activists of the control arms campaign .
The control arms campaign is pushing for a strong treaty to stop the sales of small arms around the world and was launched 5 years ago by Amnesty International , Oxfam International and the International Action Network on Small Arms .
The UN General Assembly in 061200 overwhelmingly adopted a resolution launching a process for a treaty to prevent arms transfers that fuel conflicts and serious human rights violations around the world .
Only the United States voted against .
24 Governments abstained .
That resolution asked then - UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to seek the views of Member States on the feasibility , scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive and legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import , export and transfer of conventional arms .

Denmark 's foreign intelligence admitted that claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect , yet Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that weapons of mass destruction were not the reason Denmark entered the war in Iraq .
On 4 November 2008 in an address to the Danish parliamentary Defense Commission Danish Foreign Intelligence Service ( FE ) stated --
claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect .
Fe 's work was careless .
Fe 's information was not based on credible sources .
Fe 's information sources were poor and insufficient .
Fe concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
The intelligence services of all other nations concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had WMD .
It was difficult for western intelligence agencies to operate under Saddam 's regime .
few Iraqis were able to be recruited as informants under Saddam 's regime .
Iraqis recruited as spies turned out to be weak sources .
Last week Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen defended Danish involvement in the Iraq war .
Rasmussen stated --
Politicians widely believed that Saddam Hussein kept WMD and other chemical and biological weapons .
WMD were not the official reason for Denmark entering the war in Iraq .
Denmark entered the war in Iraq because Saddam refused to cooperate with United Nations .
A majority of lawmakers in the Danish Parliament approved military action .
Defense spokesman for the opposition Social Democrat Party John dyrby paulsen told Danish television that --
Rasmussen claimed Saddam Hussein did not cooperate with the UN only because he knew that the WMD argument would not be believed .

President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica called for a global reduction of military spending as a matter of international security on November 19 , 2008 .
Costa Rica is an unarmed state .
Arias in an address before the UN Security Council said the logic that leads a poor nation to spend excessive sums on its armies and not on its people is perverse and is the antithesis of human security .
It is a serious threat to international security .
Costa Rica presides over the UN Security Council this month .
Arias said Costa Rica is not a naive nation even though it has no military .
Arias is a 1987 novel Peace Prize laureate .
Arias said Costa Rica has not come for the abolition of all armies .
Costa Rica has not come to discuss reduction of world military spending which has reached 3.3 billion dollars a day .
Costa Rica proposed instead that a gradual reduction is not only possible but also imperative particularly for developing nations .
The Costa Rican President decried the limited application of article 26 of the UN Charter .
It calls on the Security Council to use international arms control to avoid diverting human and economic resources .
Arias said article 26 has been a dead letter in the vast cemetery of intentions for world peace until now .
Arias is promoting stronger multi - lateralism .
Arias said nations will continue to arm themselves at the expense of the people 's development and international security as long as the nations do not feel protected by strong regional organizations with real powers to act .
This is particularly true in the poorest countries .
Arias urged the Security Council to apply the Costa Rica consensus .
The consensus forgives debts and provides aid for developing countries that spend more on human resources than the military .
Arias pressed the international body to support the arms trade treaty .
The Treaty would control International arms sales to prevent the illicit use of weapons .
Arias said the 640 million small arms and light weapons that exist in the world has proven to be more lethal than nuclear weapons and is one of the primary threats to national and international security .
74 percent of the small arms and light weapons are owned by civilians .

Ret . Lt. - Gen. Anatoly Sokolov announced -- Soviet - built a - 135 missile defense system around Moscow is obsolete and inefficient .
He says Russia is not strong enough to modernize the existing antimissile system and should build new missile defense technologies instead .
15 April 2002 retired Russian Space Forces General Ret . Lt. - Gen. Anatoly Sokolov announced --
Soviet - built a - 135 missile defense system around Moscow is obsolete and inefficient .
The A - 135 system is the only such system in the world .
The A - 135 system should be removed .
The A - 135 system is unable to provide protection of the area or the country .
USSR deployed a - 35 anti - ballistic missile system in 1974 .
The A - 35 --
was deployed around Moscow .
consisted of radars and 64 missile interceptors .
was continually modified with independently - targeted multiple warheads .
A - 135 launched in 1994 as latest version of A - 35 .
A - 135 includes long - and medium - range missile interceptors .
The Anti - Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty allows the US and Russia to protect a single site with no more than 100 interceptors .
Russia 's missile defense system complied with the ABM Treaty .
In 1970s the US had a similar system to protect missile fields in North Dakota .
The US has destroyed this system .
The ABM Treaty bars a nationwide missile shield of the kind the US wants to deploy .
In December 2001 President George W. Bush warned Russia that the US would withdraw from the ABM Treaty in 6 months .
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated --
US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was not a threat to Russian security .
US withdrawal from the ABM would hurt global stability .
Russian officials have said recently that the Moscow missile defense system could be upgraded in the next few years ,
Sokolov stated --
Russian government should not modernize the old missile defense system but build new missile defense technologies instead .
Modernization would be costly .
Russia is not strong enough to modernize the existing antimissile system .
Russia has lost several Soviet - built long - range radars essential for effective operation of an anti - missile system .
A new anti - missile system in Belarus would be inadequate .
Sokolov previously served as a top commander with Russia 's space forces .

Ukraine almost has all of the necessary approvals to join the European Space Agency 's program .
Ukraine is considered likely to gain the remaining approvals which will allow Ukraine to join the program and share its renowned space technologies .
The European Space Agency recommended on June 6 , 2002 that Ukraine join a multinational program that could greatly expand markets for Ukrainian space technology .
Head of the European Space Agency 's technology transfer program Pierre Brisson stated that the European Space Agency will have to ask the European Commission before confirming Ukraine can join the program .
Pierre Brisson also stated that the European Commission will most likely issue approval by August 5 , 2002 and work on the project could start on December 5 , 2002 .
The Ukrainian Government must also approve the Ukraine 's participation in the program but Deputy Director of Ukraine 's national space agency Eduard Kuznetsov stated that no problems are expected because of President Leonid Kuchma 's pro - European goals .
The European Space Agency 's endorsement followed Ukraine 's formal announcement to bid to join NATO on May 29 , 2002 .
Pierre Brisson led a team of European experts on a visit to Kiev to discuss commercial applications of Ukrainian space technology with representatives of the National Space Agency of Ukraine , scientists and business leaders .
Pierre Brisson stated that Ukraine 's materials and processing sectors are the most immediately promising to other European clients and could have a large impact on the future .
Eduard Kuznetsov stated that the space sector will outperform Ukraine 's overall integration schedules because the branch already has a record of international cooperation .
Ukraine is an impoverished former Soviet republic that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and has since a space power .
President Leonid Kuchma 's goal for Ukraine is greater integration into Europe .
A Ukrainian company built in the Soviet era called yuzmash has helped found the Sea Launch project with the United States , Russia and Norway to launch satellites from converted sea - based oil drilling platforms .
A Ukrainian cosmonaut named loenid Kadenyuk has flown a successful mission on the U.S. space shuttle .
The European Space Agency 's program has so far transferred more than 100 technologies .
15 new companies with a turnover of 150 million euros or 140 million dollars and thousands of new jobs were created as a result .
Russia already participates in the European Space Agency 's program .

Embraer opened a new factory in the Sao Paulo state of Brazil in order to better compete to win a contract with the Brazilian air force .
Embraer inaugurated a new factory to build corporate jets and expand into the military aviation sector on June 11 , 2002 .
Mauricio betelho stated that the factory will allow Embraer to enter business sectors it has not yet entered .
The factory is located in an area called gaviao Peixoto in the Sao Paulo state in Brazil .
Gaviao Peixoto is a small orange and sugar cane farming town of 4500 inhabitants about 300 kilometers or 180 miles northwest of Sao Paulo .
This location was called ideal to test military aircraft at supersonic speeds .
Embraer is investing 150 million dollars over 10 years to upgrade the factory 's technology so that the factory can produce Embraer 's new legacy corporate jet and a range of military aircraft .
The military aircraft include the EMB - 145 reconnaissance and alx super Tucano training planes .
The factory contains a 5 kilometer or 3 mile long test runway which is the longest in the southern hemisphere .
Embraer President Mauricio betelho stated that the factory is expected to employ 1000 people by 2003 and 3000 people over the next decade .
The factory is expected to attract investments by the jetmaker 's suppliers .
Kawaski heavy industries of Japan is the first supplier to invest in the factory .
This supplier will use the factory to make wings for Embraer 's new 08 seat erj 190/195 passenger jets .
Mauricio betelho stated kawaski heavy industries is likely to be just the first of several suppliers to invest in the plant .
Embraer is the world 's 4th largest aircraft manufacturer and Brazil 's top exporter .
Embraer is 1 of 4 competitors for a contract to supply the Brazilian air force with 12 new supersonic fighters .

Fathers of militants killed in Kashmir vow to continue support for independence
Mohammed Aziz 's son Imam was killed in Kashmir in January 2002 .
Militants fighting against Indian rule buried the son in the Himalayan forests .
Imam was Aziz 's eldest son .
Aziz stated that he would not hesitate to sacrifice his remaining four sons for Kashmiri independence .
Aziz is angry that President Pervez Musharraf will obstruct Pakistan 's the militant Islamic groups that send fighters into the Indian - ruled portion of Kashmir .
Aziz stated his pride of being a father of a martyr and that President Musharraf has sold the blood of hundreds of freedom fighters by stopping men from waging jihad in Kashmir .
Aziz was in Lahore near the Indian border south of Kashmir .
10000 people rallied on June 16 , 2002 in Lahore including Aziz .
Political and religious groups vowed to fight for Kashmir despite Musharraf 's promise to stop militants based in Pakistan from crossing into Indian - controlled territory to stage attacks .
Militant groups that oppose Musharraf 's crackdown and Musharraf 's support for the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan have been blamed for attacks targeting foreigners and symbols of Western influence in Pakistan .
This included a bombing outside the U.S. consulate in Karachi that killed 12 people in June 2002 .
Musharraf pledged to stop cross - border infiltration because of pressure from the United States .
The United States fears the Kashmir crisis could trigger a full - scale conflict between India and Pakistan .
The dispute over Kashmir began when India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947 .
The two countries both have nuclear weapons and have fought two wars over Kashmir .
There are increased tensions of war between India and Pakistan after an attack on an Indian army camp .
The attack killed 34 people and was one of the deadliest single assaults since 1989 .
In 1989 militants launched an insurgency in Indian - controlled Kashmir seeking independence or a merger with Islamic Pakistan .
Kashmir is India 's only Muslim - majority state .
India is dominated by Hinduism .
India accuses Islamabad of funding and training guerrillas .
The guerrillas cross the Line of Control that divides Kashmir and carry out attacks on the Indian side .
Tens of thousands of Indian troops , guerrillas and civilians have been killed .
Pakistan says it only provides moral and political support for Kashmir 's named freedom fighters .
Diplomatic intervention and Musharraf 's suppression of militants and cross - border attacks have decreased tensions of war .
There is strong resentment among Pakistan 's conservative Islamic groups .
Fighter with Hezb - ul Mujahedeen Anas Javed said that Pakistan soldiers deployed near the Kashmir border used to pray for success in Jihad but are now terrorists according to Musharra .
Hezb - ul Mujahedeen is one of the main militant groups fighting in Kashmir .
The leaders of two other outlawed Pakistani militant groups that operate in Kashmir Lashkar - e - Tayyaba and Jaish - e - Mohammed are in police custody and under house arrest respectively .
Musharraf 's crackdown has decreased tensions about war .
The dispute over Kashmir continues with no signs of abating .
A Board was created during the rally in Lahore bearing the names of militants killed during the 12 - year insurgency .
Safdar Sadiqui 's son was on it .
Sadiqui 's son was killed in Kashmir in 1993 at age 22 .
Islamic cleric Sadiqui stated that his son gave his life for Kashmir and that Sadiqui would do whatever possible to liberate Kashmir .
Sadiqui is associated with Pakistan 's main hard - line religious group Jamaat - e - Islami .
Muslim cleric Mohammed Yousaf stated his anger at the Pakistan army for preventing men from fighting against India in Kashmir at the Line of Control .
Yousaf sat beside Sadiqui .
Yousaf said that Pakistan is incomplete without Kashmir .

Cuban biotechnology pharmaceuticals program seeks to expand to overseas markets in developing countries .
The Cuban Government seeks to increase pharmaceutical profits by significantly expanding overseas markets through the development of novel pharmaceuticals and the sale of the world 's most lucrative biotechnology drug , erythropoetin ( EPO ) .
Amgen Inc. invented EPO and shares patent rights with Johnson & Johnson and Kirin Brewery in the most lucrative industrialized markets -- the US , Europe and Japan .
In 2001 EPO generated 6 billion dollars in sales for the 3 corporations .
Amgen sells EPO in the US as epogen for over 36 dollars per dose .
US epogen consumers pay over 10000 dollars each annually for the drug .
EPO is a genetically engineered protein used legally by kidney dialysis and chemotherapy patients and illegally by athletes to increase the concentration of oxygenated red blood cells .
An increasing quantity of biotechnology drugs are produced without any attempts to obtain licenses in developing nations .
US patent holders consider the trade in generic drugs a violation to their intellectual property .
Consumers in developing countries appreciate lower prices on generic drugs .
Cuba considers the generic drug trade good business and currently manufactures EPO for sale in Argentina , Brazil , India and other countries that do not acknowledge most US and European drug patents .
Cuban biotechnology executive Blanca tormo stated that Cuba carefully abides by intellectual property laws and exclusively sells EPO in countries in which no entity has exclusive patent rights .
The largest potential pharmaceutical market is in the 1.3 billion person Chinese market .
Amgen , Kirin , the small Canadian biotechnology company Dragon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and at lease 4 Chinese companies currently sell EPO in China .
The generic product costs as low as 5 dollars per dose in China .
By joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 China agreed to abide by WTO intellectual property agreements but the agreements contain mechanisms allowing developing nations to circumvent patents , particularly in pharmaceuticals , when public health concerns are deemed to override the patents .
Current state of biotechnology in Cuba --
The Cuban biotechnology industry currently generates 100 million dollars annually and reaches markets in over 40 countries .
Cuba 's genetic engineering and biotechnology center occupies modern towers approved by Fidel Castro and employs over 1000 people to engineer proteins to combat major terminal illnesses .
Cuba currently produces novel biotechnology products : hepatitis B and meningitis B vaccines , a skin growth factor , interferons , thrombosis and heart attack medicines and AIDS treatments .
Cuba has produced over 78 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine .
Cuba licensed its meningitis B vaccine to the British company GlaxoSmithKline , which hopes to eventually sell the vaccine in the United States under a Clinton - era exemption to the Cuban trade embargo .
Cuba is cooperating with the small Canadian company YM biosciences on trials of a head and neck cancer treatment .
Cuba is seeking further partnerships with foreign companies in vaccine research for AIDS , 8 types of cancer and cholera .
Cuban officials including attendees of the annual bio 2002 Industry Conference 20020600 in Toronto stated that negotiations for new biotechnology trade and production agreements were in progress with Brazil , Malaysia , Netherlands , Spain , Mexico , Venezuela , Vietnam , Ukraine , Germany and the United States .
Cuba has or is negotiating technology transfer agreements with 14 countries , chiefly developing nations including India , Algeria and South Africa .
20020500 US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton stated that the US believes Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort and has provided dual - use biotechnology to other rogue states .
Scientists , Castro , and former US President Jimmy Carter , who visited Cuba directly after Bolton 's statement , dismissed Bolton 's statement as unfair .
Tormo stated that Bolton unintentionally increased publicity for the Cuban biotechnology program .

Russian military space forces put on test duty an optical space - object tracking facility located in the ex - Soviet republic of Tajikistan
The Russian military space forces on 020718 inaugurated an optical tracking facility that is intended to monitor objects in space and put it on test duty .
The okno optical tracking facility is near the town of Nurek in the central region of the ex - Soviet republic of Tajikistan and located 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) southeast of the Tajik capital Dushanbe .
Russian Space Forces said in a statement carried by the Interfax - military news agency that the okno ( window ) complex is capable of tracking objects 40000 kilometers ( 24800 miles ) from Earth .
The okno offers a better range and precision than standard radar facilities according to the Space Forces .
The report did not elaborate on how the okno works .
The report saids Space Forces chief Col . - Gen. Anatoly Perminov traveled to the site to report on the facility 's launch to Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov , .
According to images on the Federation of American Scientists ' web site , the facility involves telescope - like equipment housed in several large spheres .
The okno is located in Tajikistan 's mountains 2200 meters ( 7260 feet ) above sea level and takes advantage of the area 's fine weather and high transparency of the atmosphere .
Such conditions are not found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union .
The site describes it as similar to the U.S. GEODSS system , or ground - based electro - optical Deep Space Surveillance .
Three such U.S. facilities are operational .
The construction of the facility started in 790000 , but stopped after the 910000 Soviet collapse when Tajikistan slid into a 5 year civil war that undermined its economy and left its population in deep poverty .
About 25000 Russian troops and border guards are deployed in Tajikistan to help protect its volatile southern border with Afghanistan and prevent drug smuggling .

Italy is leading a technology transfer initiative developed by the G - 8 countries which will improve the technology of developing countries .
The goal of the initiative is to provide the infrastructure and good governance needed to alleviate poverty .
Italy sponsors technology transfer to developing countries as a form of foreign aid and alleviating poverty .
Premier Silvio Berlusconi supported and sponsored the initiative with counterparts at recent international gatherings including the last G - 8 Summit in Canada .
Italy persuaded partners to let Italy lead the G - 8 summit 's e-government initiative called DOT Force or digital opportunity task force .
Former IBM executive and current technology minister of Italy Lucio Stanca is leading Italy 's Internet program for developing countries as part of the Group of Eight 's efforts to reduce the digital divides .
Silvio Berlusconi gave Lucio Stanca his current role of modernizing Italy 's bureaucracy .
Lucio Stanca stated that Italy will not targeting countries that have very basic needs .
The first technology transfer projects will be implemented in the fall .
One such project is creating an electronic database for real estate in Mozambique .
So far 12 million euros or 12 million dollars have been allocated to finance the initial phase of these projects .
This cost is only a fraction of the total cost .
Italy is financing most of the cost but the World Bank and possibly some private telecommunications companies are also contributing .
Lucio Stanca stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger , disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance .
The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments .
In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination .
The United Nations telecommunications agency stated that 83 countries in Africa , Asia , and the former Soviet Union still have less than 10 telephone lines for every 100 people .
Other studies note that even though the Internet has been in use for more than a decade , only about 10 percent of the world 's population has access to it .
Reducing the digital divide has taken on a central role in the fight against global poverty in recent years .
The United Nations has repeatedly stated that the world 's poor may be further marginalized if there is no improvement in access to information technology .
Reducing the digital divide was declared a priority at last year 's G - 8 Summit in Genoa which included Russia .
Italy launched pilot programs in 5 countries at a conference in Sicily sponsored by the United Nations and Italy in April , 2002 .
The Conference focused on how technologies can be used to improve administration in developing countries .
The plan for Albania is computerization of demographic surveys .
The plan for Jordan is e-procurement which will allow online trading , auctions , payment and settlement of bills .
The plan for Tunisia is the creation of electronic databases to facilitate tax collection .
The plan for Nigeria and Mozambique is the creation an electronic database for real estate .
Washington - based adviser at World Learning Ann hudock stated that poverty reduction will only occur when the poor themselves are brought into the policy process .
Oxfram America is a nonprofit development group based in Boston .
World Learning is an organization promoting education and justice .

Indian Deputy Prime Minister accuses Pakistan of becoming a haven for terrorists escaped from Afghanistan and permitting increasing guerrilla attacks in Kashmir .
20021228 Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani stated at a gathering of paramilitary police officers in New Delhi --
Intelligence reports state that al-Qaeda members have fled from American forces in Afghanistan and relocated to western Pakistan and Pakistan - controlled Kashmir , making Pakistan the new epicenter of terrorism .
Cross - border incursions by Islamic guerrillas into Indian - controlled Kashmir increased in recent weeks .
The international community must beware of the situation , which could prove expensive for any country .
Pakistan 's foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan stated in Islamabad --
The accusations were without merit .
Indian leaders have previously leveled baseless allegations at Pakistan .
India should resolve its issues with Pakistan including the core issue of Kashmir to ensure durable peace in the region , rather than accuse Pakistan .
India has refused talks with Pakistan .
Pakistani and American officials stated that over 400 Taliban and al-Qaeda suspects have been arrested in Pakistan .
20021228 the head of the Pakistan - based guerrilla group Hezb - ul Mujahadeen Syed Salahuddin stated at a meeting of Hezb commanders in mazzafarabad , the capital of Pakistani Kashmir , that Hezb will continue and increase jihad in the Indian state of Jammu - Kashmir with full force .
Hezb is the largest of over 12 militias battling Indian troops for Kashmir 's independence from mostly Hindu India , or its merger with Islamic Pakistan .
Advani stated --
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf 's assurance to the United States of ending cross - border terrorism in Kashmir , terminating militant camps and banning dozens of Islamic groups was merely cosmetic .
Many of the banned terrorist groups continued activity in Pakistan and Kashmir under new names .
The Indian army stated that 4 Islamic militants were killed in 2 separate gun battles 20021228 .
Indian army spokesman Lt. Col . Mukhtar Singh stated that soldiers stormed a militant hideout in Kreeri , a village 35 kilometers north of Srinagar , Jammu - Kashmir 's summer capital .
2 militants identified as members of the Pakistan - based Lashkar - e - Tayyaba group were killed .
Approximately 25 kilometers southwest of Sringar 2 militants were killed in a second gun battle .
Local police reported 4 civilians wounded in the crossfire .
India and Pakistan have fought 2 of 3 wars over control of Kashmir .
Both countries claim the entirety of the region .
The Islamic insurgency in Kashmir has lasted 13 years and killed over 61000 people .
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training the cross - border guerrillas .
Pakistan claims it offers moral rather than material support to the rebels , whom it considers freedom fighters .

A virus - like computer infection spread through Asian digital networks and disrupted Internet services in several countries .
The virus is thought to have utilized a security flaw in microsoft software .
A virus - like computer infection spread through worldwide digital networks and interrupted Internet service in parts of Asia on 25 January 2003 .
The infection slowed or halted web browsing and e-mail services in several countries .
Users and news media reported outages or slowdowns in Thailand , Japan , Malaysia , the Philippines , South Korea and India .
Internet service providers said a sudden surge in traffic jammed networks on the afternoon of 25 January 2003 .
Antivirus vendor Symantec Corp. estimated at least 22000 systems were affected worldwide .
A technical support representative for Internet Thailand stated --
A virus or worm attacked a bug in microsoft software .
While traffic among domestic Thai servers was normal , exchanges with international servers began slowing down around 12:00 pm ( 0500 GMT ) .
The exchanges came to a halt within hours before recovering the evening of 25 January 2003 .
U.S. officials stated the attack sought out vulnerable computers on the Internet using a known flaw in software from Microsoft Corp. called SQL server 2000 .
The attacking software code scanned for victim computers randomly and aggressively and sent out thousands of probes each second which overwhelmed many Internet data pipelines .
Local Thai subscribers stated that other Thai Internet service providers appeared to be unaffected .
NHK television in Japan reported --
Some of the Japan 's Internet connections experienced heavy traffic .
A public university computer had been hit by over 200000 transmissions in 1 hour .
Security firms were investigating the incident .
Traffic - directing computers at Korea Telecom freetel and SK Telecom failed to function in South Korea and affected millions of Internet users .
Chief system engineer at KT freetel Kim Chang - Rae stated excessive traffic caused 1 of KT freetel 's main domain servers to fail which forced other servers to shut down in a chain reaction .
Officials stated the system was restored after several hours but service remained slow .
The failure affected weekend Internet banking and shopping traffic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday .
Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. is 1 of the largest Internet providers in Taiwan .
A customer service operator from Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. stated service experienced difficulties and that some customers were n't able to access the web .

Philippine intelligence reports reveal Singapore - based al-Qaida group 's plans to bomb embassies , U.S. corporations , and warships in Singapore and to crash hijacked planes at Singapore 's National Airport .
The plans were successfully stopped in their final stages in December 2001 and 15 cell members were arrested .
Philippine intelligence reports obtained by the Associated Press reveal a Singapore - based al-Qaida group 's plans to attack embassies of the United States , Great Britain , Israel and Australia , to attack U.S. corporations and warships in Singapore and to crash a hijacked plane at the country 's international airport .
The group ordered a chemist to buy 4 tons of ammonium nitrate .
The amount is 4 times the amount of explosive that Timothy McVeigh used to bomb the Oklahoma City Federal Building .
The embassy attacks were successfully stopped in the final stages by U.S. investigators and allies in Southeast Asia but the explosives were not recovered .
1 of the phillipine reports states that Singapore is a target for terrorist attacks because of its 17000 U.S. residents and 6000 multinational companies including several American companies .
The terrorists belonged to Jemaah Islamiah designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization and described in 1 of the phillipine reports as part of the broader al-Qaida syndicate .
The group planned attacks in Singapore before and after the hijackings in the United States on 11 September 2001 .
The group is believed responsible for attacks throughout Southeast Asia .
The group is suspected in the bombings in Bali that killed approximately 200 people in October 2002 .
The attacks in Singapore were prevented after 15 individuals were arrested in December 2001 .
2 of the individuals arrested were released .
1 of the Philippine reports stated that local officials and Western business executives were shocked by the ability of Al-Qaida to plant operatives in such a tightly controlled society as Singapore .
The members of the 4 or 5 - man terror cells led normal lives and avoided contact with known Islamic organizations .
The members were not known to be active members of mosques in Singapore .
In efforts to avoid detection the members used code names and code numbers , communicated by e-mail , encrypted their computer diskettes and used prepaid mobile phone cards .
Investigators stated that after the U.S. military campaign began in Afghanistan members of Jemaah Islamiah planned to procure 21 tons of explosive materials and bought 4 tons of ammonium nitrate in an operation to attack embassies in Singapore .
The ammonium nitrate was purchased by captured Malaysian chemist and retired army captain Yazid Sufaat .
Authorities state that Sufaat hosted 11 September hijackers and the accused terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui in Malaysia at different times in 2000 .
Authorities state that Sufaat provided Moussaoui with counterfeit documents with which to enter the United States .
Moussaoui was arrested in August 2001 in Minnesota and remains the only U.S. defendant indicted as a conspirator with the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks .
The Singaporean cell members were believed to be conducting reconnaissance when they were apprehended .
The explosive materials were sent to an Indonesian island off Singapore .
During the attack planning an Indonesian and a Kuwaiti arrived in Singapore with instructions for the embassy operations .
Cell members guided them to the U.S. embassy which was videotaped including close - up shots .
The adjoining Australian embassy was also videotaped .
In a separate plot a member of the cell took digital photographs of U.S. military aircraft and personnel using Singapore 's Paya Lebar air base .
Singapore authorities believe a cell leader traveled to Afghanistan and briefed al-Qaida leaders about the proposed shuttle bus attack between August 1999 and April 2000 .
The al-Qaida officials apparently turned down the plan because the target was not large enough .
A few days after the Singapore arrests in December 2001 a videotape was found in an abandoned house in Kabul , Afghanistan in which a narrator describes locations in Singapore where bombs could be hidden to attack Americans .
Investigators searched the homes of those detained in Singapore and found an identical videotape .
The Singapore wing of Jemaah Islamiah may also have Thai connections since at least 5 members who eluded the 2001 arrests fled to Thailand .
1 of the reports stated --
The group had previously plotted to conduct 7 simultaneous explosions in different areas of Singapore .
The Group had further planned to hijack a U.S. , British or Singaporean plane and crash it into Changi Airport in order to threaten the U.S. government to halt its military strikes against Afghanistan .
In February 2003 Indonesian police announced the arrest of the alleged head of the cell in Singapore Mas Selamat Kastari who was suspected of planning the airport attack .
Kastari also was suspected in the proposed shuttle bus attack .
The reports arose after intelligence agents from Southeast Asian countries realized after the 11 September 2001 attacks that many radical Islamic groups in the region had close connections to each other and to Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network .

The Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil build a nuclear submarine .
It also wants to establish a strategic partnership with France involving exchange of experiences and knowledge and hopes to discuss deals involving France 's Rafale fighter jet and the Cougar cargo helicopter .
Brazil 's Defense Ministry said 080128 that the Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil become the first country in Latin America to have a nuclear submarine .
Defense ministry spokesman Jose Ramos said Defense Minister Nelson Jobim traveled to France during 080120-080126 with the main objective of the visit being to discuss the possible purchase of a diesel - powered Scorpene class submarine that would serve as a model for the development of a nuclear submarine .
Ramos said that any defense - related agreement that may eventually be signed with the Government of France must include the transfer of technology and noted that Brazil has nuclear reactors and fuel enrichment capacity but has not had the technology to build a nuclear submarine .
Ramos declined to confirm a report published 080128 by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper saying that the Brazilian Government would buy the submarine for US $ 600 million and pay off the amount over 20 years at an annual interest rate of 2.4 percent .
The Brazilian Government has discussed building a nuclear submarine for decades and began a formal program in 1979 .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced US $ 540 million in new funding for the program and for existing uranium enrichment efforts in 070700 .

International Atomic Energy Agency director ElBaradei says the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .
Director General of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei told a conference of the world 's top defense officials on 080209 that the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .
ElBaradei urged a reduction of the world 's nuclear stockpile and better controls and said that an extremist group would use nuclear weapons upon procuring such weapons .
ElBaradei said that even countries which have nuclear weapons know that a country which uses nuclear weapons will be pulverized but that extremist groups will use nuclear weapons if possible .
ElBaradei said that countries need to be aware that extremist groups procuring nuclear weapons is the number one security threat the world is facing and added as a note of caution that given the state of the system of international controls it was hard to determine whether nuclear materials were ending up with extremist groups .
ElBaradei said much of the material that is reported stolen is never recovered and that a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen .
ElBaradei said in reference to Iran that the international community should quickly engage in talks with the Iranian government to secure guarantees that the Iranian nuclear program will not be used to develop weapons and that such confidence can only be built through direct negotiations .
U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman said that Iran remained the world 's top arms control challenge and that it would be a profound mistake to focus on the recent U.S. national intelligence estimate that suggested Iran no longer had a nuclear weapons program .
Lieberman pointed out that in the Nie report which said that the Iranian government 's covert work on bomb design may have been temporarily suspended in 03000 it was also and far more importantly stated that Iran 's overt work on enrichment continues apace .
German foreign minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier similarly emphasized that the Nie report in no way grants Iran any kind of absolution .
Germany has been working with the 5 permanent U.N. Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear issue .
Steinmeier consequently believes it is right for the international community to keep up the pressure on Iran .
Steinmeier said that in the interests of global safety the international community 's common goals must continue to be to prevent Iranian nuclear armament and to counteract the erosion of the Nonproliferation Treaty .

Indian police stated that the man headed an illegal organ transplant ring based in the upscale New Delhi suburb of gurgao .
The syndicate may have sold up to 500 kidneys to clients who traveled to India from around the world in the past 9 years .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that no accurate estimate of how many people are trafficked for organs exists but a conservative estimate would be 15000 trafficked kidneys per year .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that there strong cases documenting coercion in Eastern Europe , Turkey , Israel , India and the United States .
Nancy schepeter - Hughes stated that most victims of kidney trafficking are coerced by need and not by physical force .

Yosuke shimazono wrote the paper .
The paper also noted that the international organ trade is not well understood because of a lack of data and lack of effort to integrate the available information .
The Vienna Forum ends on February 15 , 2008 and is being convened by the United Nations global initiative to fight human trafficking .

Santos backed off slightly and told the Associated Press on 080305 that Colombian authorities have no evidence or indication that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are seeking to use the uranium to build a radioactive dirty bomb .
Santos said in a telephone interview from Brussels that what Santos had meant was to take note and not take it lightly and said that putting the FARC rebels and the word uranium in the same sentence was alarming .
The FBI has an office in Bogota and Spokesman Richard kolko said in Washington that the FBI has no information or intelligence regarding the FARC attempting to use weapons of mass destruction .
The FARC has been fighting successive Colombian Governments for more than 4 decades using conventional weapons .
The document addressing uranium was found in a laptop belonging to a top FARC commander named Raul Reyes .
Reyes was killed on 080301 in a raid into Ecuador that has generated intense international criticism .
The poorly written communication addressed to Reyes was dated 080216 and was signed by Edgar Tovar .
Santos said Tovar commands a FARC front near Ecuador .
Tovar wrote that a man named Belisario in Bogota supplies Tovar with explosives and sent Tovar a catalog and specifications .
Tovar wrote that Belisario proposed to sell each kilo at US $ 2.5 million and deliver it and that Tovar and Reyes would then find a buyer .
Tovar wrote the deal would be with a Government and to sell them a sizable amount .
Tovar wrote Belisario had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as Belisario had direct contact with uranium suppliers .
The uranium reference in Tovar 's writing was quickly cited by Colombia 's government while seeking to deflect criticism over the raid .
Gen. Oscar Naranjo said at an explosive news conference that the FARC mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the FARC are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists .
Santos took Colombia 's complaints to the European Union 's foreign affairs representative Javier Solano on 080305 .
Santos told the AP after meeting with Solano that the Europeans were really worried about the uranium and were not taking the issue lightly .
Colombian officials say they have no other information from the laptop or other sources indicating FARC interest in radioactive materials or unconventional weapons .
It was n't clear what exactly the material Tovar was writing about might be .
Santos said the uranium mentioned in the communication sounded like processed uranium .
The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous .
Charles Ferguson is a physicist with the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and said that unprocessed uranium is relatively harmless and goes for about US $ 100 a kilo .
Ferguson expressed fear if the uranium in question were the highly enriched weapons - grade uranium capable of being used in a low - yield improvised nuclear device .
Ferguson was not aware of any highly enriched uranium of appreciable quantities in the region near Colombia and Venezuela .

A parliamentary commission report said on April 9 , 2008 that money from drug trafficking in Bulgaria has been used to fund terrorist groups .
A parliamentary commission report stated on April 9 , 2008 that money from drug trafficking in Bulgaria has been used to fund terrorist groups .
The report said Bulgarian crime groups engaged in trafficking and drugs sometimes work together with Arab citizens linked to terrorist organizations .
The Associated Press obtained a copy of the document .
The report said that part of the profit from trafficking in drugs such as amphetamines has been used to finance terrorist organizations like Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad , and Christian militias in Lebanon .
The U.S. State Department said in its 2008 international narcotics control strategy report that Bulgaria continues to be a source of drug production .
Part of that is being smuggled into Turkey and the Middle East .
The parliamentary report was issued amid revelations of illegal links between senior police officers and criminals .
The document said the amount of illegal drugs seized by authorities declined after classified police information had been leaked to criminals .
The leaks prompted the arrest of senior police and a motion of no - confidence from opposition parties .
The document is based on figures from the National Security Agency .
The motion will be voted on April 11 , 2008 .
Bulgaria 's government has been repeatedly criticized by the European Union over its inability to tackle rampant corruption and organized crime .
Bulgaria 's government is a Socialist - led coalition .
Bulgaria is a Balkan country of 7.7 million people and lies on a major drug trafficking route linking Western Europe , the Middle East and southwestern Asia .

25 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were convicted and sentenced to jail time while 15 members were acquitted .
The charges against members of the Muslim Brotherhood included money laundering and terrorism .
A security official stated that on 15 April 2008 an Egyptian military court known for severe verdicts convicted 25 key members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood with sentences up to 10 years in jail .
The security official attended the trial at the court north of Cairo but spoke on condition of anonymity because the official is not authorized to speak to the media .
The official stated the charges against members of Egypt 's largest opposition group included money laundering and terrorism but it was not immediately clear if the 25 were found guilty of both offenses .
The official stated that 15 other defendants were acquitted .
Among the acquitted were businessman Abdel - Rahman Saudi who runs a supermarket chain in Egypt and a journalist .
Authorities created a security ring around the courthouse with 100s of policemen creating checkpoints on the road leading to the court before the verdict announcement .
Police searched vehicles and drove away reporters and family members of the defendants .
A security official stated that approximately 20 people including relatives and reporters were detained .
Defense lawyer Abdel - Moneim Abdel - Maksoud stated the judge entered the courtroom and issued the ruling but then left without notifying the opposition group 's defense lawyers who stood outside the courthouse after being prevented by policemen from entering the courtroom .
The 25 sentenced included the Brotherhood 's chief strategist Khayrat El-Shater and the Brotherhood 's prominent financier and businessman Hassan Malek .
El-Shater joined the Brotherhood in 1974 and has been jailed 4 times for a total of 7 years on charges relating to membership in the Brotherhood which was outlawed before 1958 .
Malek owns a chain of furniture stores and textile factories and is known as 1 of the Brotherhood 's main financiers .
El-Shater and Malek each received 7 - year sentences .
El-Shater and Malek 's property was confiscated and is believed to be worth millions of dollars .
Abdel - Maksoud stated the confiscation will affect the Brotherhood 's financial bases .
Abdel - Maksoud stated that a recent amendment to the Egyptian judicial system allows defendants to appeal within 60 days .
The 25 people sentenced have been in custody since December 2006 .
The arrests were believed to have been sparked by a militia - style demonstration by student Brotherhood members from the Al-Azhar University in Cairo .
The demonstrators wore black and masks similar to those of the militant Palestinian Hamas and Lebanon 's Hezbollah groups .
The demonstration prompted a government investigation into whether the Brotherhood had resurrected a military wing .
The Brotherhood figures were referred to a military court after the arrests .
The referral is authorized under emergency laws in effect since 1981 that allow the president to refer civilians to military tribunals .
Brotherhood members have since been routinely tried before military courts but the trial in 2007-2008 is the largest in years .
The verdict in the yearlong trial occurred amid a government crackdown on the Brotherhood and unrest in Egypt over rising food prices and stagnant wages .
More than 800 Brotherhood members have been detained in 2008 in an effort to decrease influence as President Hosni Mubarak enters the 27th year in power .
100s of Brotherhood members and supporters have been detained in Security sweeps since October 2006 .
The 40 senior figures on trial were detained as part of the sweeps .
7 senior figures were tried in absentia and are believed to be outside the country .
Some of the 7 's whereabouts are unknown .
5 of the absent senior figures received 10 - year prison terms including Swiss - based Egyptian - born businessman Youssef M. Nada whose company has been listed by the United States since 2001 as an organization accused of helping fund terrorism .
London - based human rights group Amnesty International called the sentences on 15 April 2008 a perversion of justice and demanded the men be released and retried in a civilian court .
Amnesty International said in a statement that the sentences leave little doubt that the Egyptian authorities are determined to undermine what has become the main opposition group in Egypt .
Amnesty International stated trying civilians before military courts flouts international standards of fair trial and is inherently unjust .
The Muslim Brotherhood 's supreme leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef denounced the verdict and stated that Egyptian authorities are corrupt gangsters .
Akef stated to the Associated Press that there was no evidence against the convicted and that acquittals for the convicted are expected .
Akef stated in a telephone interview that gangs not politicians rule Egypt .
Akef would not discuss the Brotherhood 's future plans .
The Brotherhood won 88 of parliament 's 454 seats in the 2005 elections with Brotherhood candidates running as independents .

South African government officials will not intervene to disallow Chinese arms shipment to Zimbabwe despite volatile political situation following contested presidential election .
South African officials approved transit of the arms shipment to Zimbabwe stating it can not act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
On 17 April 2008 a South African government spokesman stated that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese - made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe despite the acute instability of the political situation in Zimbabwe .
South African government spokesman Themba Maseko stated that the Zimbabwean government 's failure to release election results 2 weeks after elections is cause for great concern and that the dire situation requires mediation .
Maseko 's comments were the strongest issued on the subject by the South African Government to date .
South African President Thabo Mbeki is the main mediator in Zimbabwe .
Mbeki has stated that there is no crisis in Zimbabwe despite the increasing violence and intimidation since the 29 March 2008 vote and the refusal of Zimbabwe 's election commission to release results that independent observers and the opposition State show President Robert Mugabe lost the vote .
Critics call the South African reaction appeasement .
Criticism increased on 17 April 2008 following a report that South African mediator Sydney Mufamadi led an arms control committee meeting that approved transit of a shipment of Chinese weapons across South African territory en route to Zimbabwe .
The Chinese ship called an Yue Jiang docked in Durban harbor in South Africa after receiving approval from Port authorities late on 16 April 2008 .
The Beeld newspaper stated the ship was carrying approximately 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK - 47s , approximately 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket - propelled grenades .
The newspaper stated it obtained a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election on 01 April 2008 .
A South African government official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the presence of weapons on the ship but gave no further details .
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not immediately be reached for comment .
Government spokesman Maseko stated that if administrative papers are in order the Government of South Africa can not intervene to prevent weapons from being transported through its territory to a neighboring landlocked country .
After a cabinet meeting Maseko stated to reporters --
The Government of South Africa can not act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .
South Africa is not involved in the arrangement .
It would be possible but very difficult for South Africa to intervene and to disallow the shipment .
There was presently no trade embargo against Zimbabwe .
China is one of Zimbabwe 's main trade partners and allies .
A group representing mainly white South Africans called afriforum stated it would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .
Afriforum 's kallie kriel stated that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had granted approval for the transit of the weapons on 14 April 2008 .
Kriel stated he had written to Committee Chairman and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi asking him to retract the permission .
Kriel stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory effectively means that the government is replacing its ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with a more catastrophic policy of complicity with the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against its own citizens .
The South African opposition Democratic Alliance agreed with kriel 's comments .
Mufamadi also heads the South African mediating team between Zimbabwe 's ruling ZANU - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
Mufamadi 's office referred reporters to the Arms Control Committee whose spokesman did not immediately return phone calls .

The South African Government stated on April 4 , 2008 that the South African Government will probably not stop the arms shipment head to Zimbabwe .
This decision is controversial because Zimbabwe is currently politically unstable .
A South African government spokesman stated on April 4 , 2008 that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese - made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe even though the political situation in Zimbabwe is dire .
The shipment is in a ship called the an Yue hiang which was anchored outside Durban harbor after receiving permission late on April 16 , 2008 to dock .
The shipment contains nearly 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK - 47s , about 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket - propelled grenades .
This report comes from the Beeld newspaper which claimed to have a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized on April 1 , 2008 which was 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election .
An anonymous government official confirmed that the shipment contained weapons but gave no further details .
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not be reached for comment .
The South African Revenue Service said customs officials were bound by confidentiality rules and could not give details of the content of the cargo .
Spokesman Themba Maseko stated as long as administrative papers are in order South Africa can not intervene to prevent weapons being transported through South African territory to Zimbabwe .
Defense Secretary January Masilela confirmed to South African radio that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee granted approval for the transit of the weapons .
January Masilela stated that if the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government , South Africa has nothing to do with the transaction because South Africa works according to established international conventions which allow the nation no jurisdiction over goods in transit .
Sydney Mufamadi is the government official who approved the transit and he is the same official who heads the team mediating in the Zimbabwe crisis .
Themba Maseko stated that the situation in Zimbabwe is dire because elections are held and results are not released 2 weeks after .
This was the strongest comment on Zimbabwe so far by the South African Government .
On April 17 , 2008 Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called on South Africa and President Thabo Mbeki to step aside as mediator for Zimbabwe in favor of Zambia 's president , who has taken a tougher stance toward Mugabe .
Afriforum criticized the decision to approve the arms shipment .
Afriforum is a lobbying group representing mainly white South Africans .
Afriforum stated that the group would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .
Kallie kriel of afriforum stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory will in effect mean that the Government is replacing an ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with an even more catastrophic policy of complicity to the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against Zimbabwean citizens .
The South African Revenue Service stated that the ship would be subject to standard inspection procedures and the cargo would not be released until ithe cargo was proved to be compliant to customs formalities .
The approval process can be lengthy .
Zimbabwe is a landlocked country neighboring Zimbabwe ,

The Security Council resolution notes that some unnamed countries have not filed a report on the member nations efforts to adopt these laws .
The report was due to the United Nations in 041000 .
The 080425 Security Council resolution stresses the need to enhance the coordination of national , regional and international efforts to strengthen a global response to the serious challenge of keeping weapons from terrorists and the threat to international security .
The 040400 Security Council resolution was adopted to close a loophole in global efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution 1540 was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists , criminal scientists , black marketeers and other non - State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction .
Resolution 1540 was introduced as the International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology .
The black market investigation was encouraged by Pakistan 's admission in 040200 that Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to Iran , Libya and North Korea .
Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist , was Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to adopt laws to prevent non - State actors from manufacturing , acquiring or trafficking in nuclear , biological or chemical weapons , the materials to make them , and the missiles and other systems to deliver them .
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to take measures to account for and secure these weapons , missiles and other weapons material .
Resolution 1540 also demands that countries develop border controls and step up law enforcement efforts to detect , deter , prevent and combat the illicit trafficking and brokering of weapons of mass destruction .

The 080425 resolution also calls on the Resolution 1540 Committee to continue to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation by all States by reaching out to countries , facilitating technical assistance , and promoting shared experience and lessons learned .
The Security Council stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 Committee the state 's national reports on implementation of Resolution 1540 and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long - term task that will require continuous efforts at national , regional and international levels .
The Security Council stated that full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States includes the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure implementation of the Resolution 1540 inspired national laws .
Dumisani Kumalo stated that many developing countries find the reporting requirements for Resolution 1540 and other resolutions onerous when they are trying to provide food , health care and jobs for the people of developing countries .
Dumisani Kumalo is the current Security Council president and South Africa 's United Nations ambassador .
Dumisani Kumalo stated that one of the things that South Africa is happy about is that countries must cooperate in dealing with the networks that may be spreading illict nuclear and other weapons .
The 080425 resolution was approved on the day that Mohamed ElBaradei angrily criticized Israel for bombing an alleged Syrian nuclear facility , chastised the United States for withholding information on the alleged Syrian nuclear facility , and stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency would investigate the allegations of the Syrian nuclear facility .

A leading arms expert stated that China 's improved nuclear arsenal raises questions about the Chinese government 's future arms control efforts .
The expert praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons abroad .
A leading arms expert stated on 8 May 2008 that Chinese government is making dramatic improvements to China 's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts .
Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Bates Gill spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to Beijing to promote an annual report on the global arms industry .
Gill stated --
Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of China 's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times .
China stands out due to the effort to modernize , expand and improve nuclear weapons capability .
Among the 5 nuclear Powers China is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions .
The Chinese Government stated China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and China 's arsenal , estimated at just over 100 nuclear - armed missiles , is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon Powers .
Chinese officials signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992 and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of China 's deterrent force .
Gill stated that improvements in China 's conventional military are even more dramatic after more than 10 years of double - digit percentage increases in annual defense spending .
Gill stated the large increase in the military capability of China is targeted mostly at Taiwan but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere .
Taiwan is a self - governing island that China claims is part of China 's territory and has threatened to invade .
Gill stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of China as a player in the arms control agenda and that the Chinese government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons .
Gill praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which Gill believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society .
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute China has only a 2 percent share of the global arms export trade .
Gill stated that the shift in the way the Chinese government views the problem of nonproliferation is very positive .
Gill stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones , particularly in Africa where Chinese arms are used by both government and rebel forces in Sudan 's Darfur region .
Retired People 's Liberation Army Colonel Teng jianqun spoke alongside Gill on the panel and stated that China has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad .
Teng conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the Government 's direct control .
Teng stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules , partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry - sponsored China Arms Control and Disarmament Association of which Teng is Deputy Secretary - General .
Teng stated a belief that the Chinese have been putting more effort into export controls .

Japan 's lower house APPROVES BILL allowing use of space programs in national defense .
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to its tightly controlled military and would overturn a ban on the military use of space .
On 13 May 2008 Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament voted to allow Japan 's space programs to be utilized for national defense .
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to the tightly controlled military technically known as a self - defense force .
The legislation is expected to be approved by the upper house .
The legislation is primarily aimed at permitting military use of Japan 's civilian - controlled spy satellite network for defense as defined by the pacifist constitution .
The bill states that space development has become increasingly important .
The bill states that space programs must contribute to ensure peace and safety of international society as well as the national security of Japan .
The bill does not specify how the programs will be utilized but the satellite network and other assets could potentially be used for surveillance , planning and for a missile defense shield Japan is constructing with the United States .
The bill would overturn a ban on the military use of space imposed on Japan 's nascent space program in 1969 .
The U.S. - drafted 1947 Constitution prohibits Japan from offensive warfare .
The legislation stipulates that all members of the cabinet and not just education , science and technology ministers will be responsible for Japan 's future space projects .
Inclusion of the defense minister in decisions on space programs introduces the possibility for the military to possess and develop spy satellites .
The legislation would establish a special space task force led by the Prime Minister and create the new post of space development minister .
Japan 's Defense Agency was upgraded to Ministry status in 2007 .
Japanese troops were dispatched to a combat zone for the first time since World War II in 2004 .
The mission in Iraq was strictly humanitarian .
Support .
Both the ruling coalition and the largest opposition party support the bill .
The nation 's largest newspaper Yomiuri approved of the bill and urged its quick enactment .
In a weekend editorial the newspaper Yomiuri stated that it is logical to use space development for national security and necessary to counter the threat of North Korea 's missile program .
Opposition .
Some pacifist lawmakers from the Communist and Social Democratic parties boycotted the vote on 13 May 2008 stating that the bill contradicted the principle of a civilian - controlled space program .
The left - leaning newspaper Asahi raised concerns that the legislation could escalate friction with neighboring countries .

7 NATO allies to sign agreement to create a cyber Defense Research Center in Estonia .
Experts from NATO member states will be recruited to conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist allies with response to the growing threat of cyber attack .
7 NATO allies are prepared to sign a deal on 14 May 2008 to create a research center in Tallinn , Estonia to improve the NATO alliance 's defenses against cyber attacks .
Cyber attacks are considered a growing threat to military and civilian computer networks .
In 2007 Estonia experienced an unprecedented number of cyber attacks that disabled government and corporate computer networks .
The attacks occurred after a dispute between the Governments of Russia and Estonia over the relocation of a Soviet war memorial .
Many Estonians suspect the Russian government was responsible for the cyber attacks but the Government of Russia denies involvement .
Defense chiefs from Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Germany , Italy , Spain and Slovakia will sign the agreement to provide staff and funding for the center .
The United States will join the project as an observer and other NATO nations may join later .
Signing of the Agreement is a peripheral issue of the meeting of Chiefs of Defense Staff from the 26 ally countries of NATO .
The meeting is expected to focus on NATO missions in Afghanistan and Kosovo .
The generals will also discuss cooperation with Balkan and former Soviet nations including Russia and Ukraine .
The Cyber Defense Center will be operational in August 2008 with the formal opening planned for 2009 .
A staff of 30 specialists will conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist NATO members with response to any future cyber attacks .
Head of the center major Raul rikk stated to the Associated Press in Tallinn --
The attacks against Estonia last year were cyber terrorism .
The mission of the center is to create new capabilities to fight new threats .
Experts will be recruited from various NATO member States and from various sectors including information technology , science , military and finance .
Estonia is 1 of Europe 's most Internet - savvy nations .
Estonia proposed creation of the center in 2003 but it was not until after the cyber attacks of 2007 that NATO leaders were convinced it was needed .
Establishing Models in Industrial Innovation
After its competitor invented the front loading washing machine , the CEO of the American IM company believed that each of its employees had the ability for innovation , and formulated strategic countermeasures for innovation in the industry .
1. Establish an innovation fund with a maximum amount of 1,000 U.S. dollars .
2. Choose 100 innovative concepts to encourage employees to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time .
3. From among them , pick out 50 for submission to an assessment committee to assess .
Since the Tangshan Earthquake , the starting point for construction standards in the mainland is that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , buildings should preserve their basic frame without collapsing .
However , most of the buildings in this hard - hit area did not meet these requirements , with the widespread collapse of school buildings in particular arousing intense public disgust .
Raising standards to in excess of Tangshan 's 8.0 magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .
According to information leaked from numerous channels , we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck , the serious earthquake risk in the Ngawa region was already well known to the CCP .
Although current forecasting standards can not give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there is considerable experience accumulated both in China and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of a month , and the area of a province .
In regions where the earthquake risk is high , warning the public and spreading disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualties during earthquakes ; this is the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake .
In the past the CCP has done a lot of these sorts of things , but on this occasion not only did nothing , but in response to queries from the public pulled out some whopping lies , playing syntax games with words like " geological disaster " and " earthquake disaster " .
I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt , then on that day of May 12 , once the Earthquake Administration had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8 , we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .
If the simulation program was well designed , circumstances like debris blocking roads , heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops , power and communication outages should all have been within expectations .
Instead in this instance the Liberation Army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition , as the soldiers all rushed straight to Wenchuan , without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly - hit areas Beichuan , Qingchuan and Gansu 's Longnan ; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration .
In addition , the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface . In the past , Red Army regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio . On this occasion though , people had no way to deal with the communication failure .
It is clear that preparations prior to the event were not constructed on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation .
While it should have been a disaster relief command that takes overall leadership , it has suddenly come face - to - face with the broad base of disaster victims , directly dealing with them .
The lack or serious shortage of intermediate layers of Party organizations and units between the two has resulted in its inability to consider major issues with endless minor issues on hand , such that even if it is highly capable , it wo n't last long , as it will be dragged down by numerous petty things .
This would have been unimaginable during the Great Tangshan Earthquake . A time without volunteers or mental workers , such petty things as directly dealing with average people were performed by the most primary Party branches , as well as enterprises and public institutions .
As soon as the earthquake occurred , grass - root organizations contacted their own people and average people also contacted their own systems or departments , in an interdependent manner .
Under the centralized leadership of higher - level organizations , everyone acted to make the rescue efforts very outstanding and successful , such that the Great Tangshan Earthquake , which happened just a few years ago , was forgotten all together in the subsequent reform and opening - up .
It is obvious that no social or political problems were left then , nor were sequelae that cause headaches to later generations .
During a time of prosperity and happiness , such a big earthquake suddenly struck .
Many people died , much property was destroyed , it was quite clearly a great disaster .
But it was not totally without benefits , and I believe that its greatest benefit was that it served to strip off the false benevolence that composed the outer skin of the elitists , the politicians , the capitalists , and exposed once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within .
And an additional benefit was that many people who had been deluded came to their senses .
Temporarily laid aside these abstract things and avoided speaking at length , saying only a few details that left the elitists , the politicians and capitalists highly embarrassed .
The experts had just finished saying " Sacrificing yourself to help others is a foolish idea " , when the leaders had no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion .
This was mere chicanery , to the point where before engaging in life - saving , donation to charity , these sorts of behaviors , an idea had to be flashing through people 's minds :
Am I being foolish in doing this ?
And when people saw on CCTV those private firms manufacturing tents in Jiangsu and Zhejiang working overtime to produce more tents , the first idea that popped to mind I 'm afraid was probably " This time these capitalists have struck it big ! "
" Why is it that these capitalists instead of those capitalists get the big order forms , surely there could n't be anything fishy involved ?
During this process , there were again talks about filing a complaint against the Xinghui Travel Agency .
The reason for filing the complaint is that even if we owed their hourly fees , they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they signed : driving people from Canberra back to Sydney .
As long as we stick to this issue , Xinghui surely has no way of winning the lawsuit if it goes to court .
However , what greatly surprised me was the attitude of the student union in this appeal . They seemed very reluctant to make the contract public .
They even lied , saying that they and Xinghui initially felt that signing a contract would rather make each other feel like strangers since they were both doing it for the sake of the motherland .
As you know , this type of logic absolutely wo n't work in Australia .
Xinghui accepted this order of ours and deployed all the buses of other travel agencies in Sydney .
Without the guarantee from the contract signed with us , they would surely have been unable to deploy them !
In addition , there was something else that was very suspicious .
I heard from a friend at the consulate that the government took this matter very seriously and had promptly agreed to allocate funds to compensate the students who had used their own money instead that night .
Yesterday afternoon I went back to check out the torch relay , but even the flame was practically impossible to see , let alone the guys carrying the torch .
There were so many people there it was frightening . Some had even climbed onto the roofs of buses !
I headed straight for the center of activities , but in actual fact traffic was being controlled as early as 4 o'clock , and they had already started limiting the crowds entering the sports center .
Some guys were really insane , banding together in groups and yelling out " Go China ! "
I actually had some other classmates there , and was going to call them .
I guessed the carrying capacity of the base station towers was totally overloaded , and I could n't get through at all . I was only able to find a signal , not a chance of connecting to the Internet .
Only one phone call I made there got through - that was calling home .
I had a look at my call register , and out of dozens of calls dialed only one was properly connected !
Sometime after 6 I went straight back home to watch it on TV . The spectacle was just as astonishing on TV , except that it was just one angle of the whole thing .
Next time I wo n't be partaking in this kind of activity !!
Wang Shi 's experience of being under public condemnation underscored to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor classes in Chinese society ;
because as China grows prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remaining 1.3 billion people is widening .
Thirty years ago , people had basically the same incomes , which were all deplorably meager .
However , Hurun Report ( Hurun Report ) shows that by 2007 , there were a total of 106 billionaires ( in U.S. dollars ) in China , with the number of people only next to that of the United States .
Now , Wang Shi said , these responses have had effects on me .
He admitted that he was not sensitive enough to the current situation when he wrote his blog .
Wang Shi noted additionally that since China currently has not yet established a sound system of social security insurance , the growing hatred of the rich is unavoidable .
On Tuesday , Wanke announced that it would make an additional donation of RMB 100 million yuan for the temporary resettlement and post - disaster reconstruction in the next three to five years .
Yao Ming , the basketball player who was hailed as a national hero thanks to his success in establishing himself in NBA , was also blamed after he announced his donation of RMB two million yuan because a rumor on the Internet alleged he had donated one million U.S. dollars for disaster relief of Hurricane Katrina ( Hurricane ) in 2005 .
Even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from two principles , namely that it is voluntary and does not seek return . Otherwise , the donation loses its original meaning .
In actual fact , whether it is McDonalds or any other foreign owned enterprises in China on the so - called " international iron rooster " blacklist , they all gave generously to the cause of helping the disaster victims , exhibiting their social responsibility .
Even if by comparison some companies really did n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besieged or subjected to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .
Donating , after all , is not a legal obligation that companies must carry out . Urging businesses to donate apart from the force of moral considerations should not take the form of any other coercive means .
As long as a company 's source of income is legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligations is a kind of theft .
Even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief , legal order and the rights bestowed upon by law should be respected .
If we are unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid becoming a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .
The lawsuit proposed by Hai Ming did not have a clear subject of the right of action ; moreover it did not satisfy the legal requirement for libel .
For example , he failed to clarify whether Cafferty 's comment was an argument over opinions or an act of spreading an untruthful statement .
The malicious intent of Cafferty has not been established , either . More importantly , he has been unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the 1.3 billion Chinese people .
In addition , in his complaint , it is said that Chinese people have already expressed their displeasure through demonstrations .
Here it is a country with the freedom of speech .
On the issue of libel , courts only support those who have actually suffered damages and have no other way to seek justice .
Therefore , it is very hard for the government , politicians , and public figures to get legal protection on the issue of libel ,
because they have the capability to clear themselves of " smears . "
If you have already cleared your own reputation through legal protests , for example , Chinese people are not goons and thugs , then a lawsuit is meaningless .
Remember , a lawsuit for libel is only to clear your name and get compensation .
After Lee Teng - hui put forth the " two states theory " , due to mainland countrymen being deceived by the CCP 's propaganda machine , many people advocated using force to unite Taiwan .
Because they have no understanding whatsoever of the situation in Taiwan and the will of the Taiwan people ,
they universally exhibited extreme nationalistic sentiment .
Just like the love - hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupted after the US mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy .
They similarly did not understand the real story in Kosovo .
But Hong Kong people realize that first there was the Republic of China , only after that came " New China " ;
While this " Two States Separatist Theory " has purely and simply been dreamed up by the CCP .
Lee Teng - hui was doing nothing but bringing an already existing phenomenon to light .
Moreover , the grand old men of the CCP who handed over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in Manchuria north of the Amur River to Soviet Russia , who gave away land equivalent to ten percent of national territory in northern Mongolia ; why not take this back , instead of insisting on trying to grab back a Taiwan that remains in the hands of Chinese people ?
However , even though Hong Kong people have their grumbles , the " two states theory " has in no way triggered a sentimental attachment in Hong Kong people for " Old China " .
I believe that our building industry here has not yet reached this level .
Not only has the law not yet reached this level , but the average person 's understanding has generally not reached this level .
Some officials , out of local economic considerations , by accident or design are frequently too lenient in dealing with property agents .
We all saw the damage wreaked by the Wenchuan Earthquake .
As to how much of this was a result of natural disaster , and how much was man - made calamity , a verdict will be drawn in the end .
Apparently , quality checks in the space industry are extremely rigorous , each part undergoes several inspection processes , every effort is made to ensure absolute safety .
But space ship accidents still happen from time to time .
Even such technologically advanced nations as the US have experienced several instances of space flight launch or return failures .
Since things can still go wrong even when they are subjected to incredibly rigorous inspections as in the space industry , then , with our current " dark " and corrupt property industry the way it is , people 's lives are even harder to place guarantees on .
Once a powerful earthquake strikes , the people 's lives really do become as tiny as those of ants .
It makes one tremble even without fear .
Following the Great Wenchuan Earthquake this time , there were compatriots who struggled out of the debris , wiped their tears and buried the bodies of their families , but they braced up again and declared to the world , " we are not beaten down ; we are on our feet again ; the earthquake can not shake the staunch will of the Chinese people ; trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation ! "
This enables us to see the fighting spirits of the dauntless Chinese nation give off a dazzling radiance among people in disaster - hit areas .
The fact that these words are spoken by compatriots who have been through the disaster has given us , who could n't help our tears at the sight of their mishaps , so much comfort and encouragement . It gives us a hint that no force can beat down the Chinese people .
However , the words later reappeared somewhere else and from someone unusual , which I thought about for a few days . I feel , for some unknown reason , it is somewhat scary !
I just want to say , let there be no more disasters , so that China is safe and sound from now on and disasters are far away from China .
I pray to the God to open his eyes and do n't let disasters visit the Chinese land again !
We do n't want to revitalize the nation through trials and tribulations ,
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by passing our days safe and sound !
One important reason that a great number of people buried or trapped in debris in the Wenchuan earthquake - hit area were saved is that they were full of hopes and firmly believed the PLA would come to their rescue !
To settle victims , thousands of tents that stretched miles were soon set up , which contained public toilets , shops , and primary schools and middle schools .
Tens of thousands or even millions of those displaced by the disaster have gradually had a home to shelter from the wind and rain !
If everything were put in the market , such that all the land was sold to syndicates or farm owners , then where should the government set up tents ?
Do they expropriate the land on the spot ?
Even the government can not override the market !
Supporting the disaster - hit areas has tested our competence , while the government 's ability to rule also stood the trial !
At critical moments , the ruling foundation --- workers and farmers , showed staunch support to the government !
If everything were put in the market , such that workers and farmers would have their fates controlled by the market and no longer count on or rely on the government by walking onto a path of the so - called " finding the market rather than the mayor ( government ) , " then what power would the government have ?
The post - catastrophe hyperinflation as expected by foreigners has not come either !
The government has human and financial capital under control , as well as energy and resources !
For example , the value of " seizing the pleasure of the moment " also has a long history .
" Sing a song when thou have wine , seize the day since life is short . " Some people in contemporary times think we should " satisfy and die . "
Some people have gone so far on the road that they " do n't know how to eat or play , "
and other take nude pictures and flaunt them online .
For another example , the pursuit of office titles and levels can also be traced back to the old days .
In ancient times there was Zhou Li to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility , constructing a pyramid - like social organizational structure .
The son of the Heaven wore different clothes than others . The color of a door and the number of caldrons used for meals were all symbols to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility of people .
The aim was to settle disputes , stop fights and stabilize the society .
However , simultaneously it has also established a system that values life according to office levels , which to the contrary triggered contentions and destabilized the society .
Yet no matter how many changes of dynasties there are , the value system has always been carried on .
Higher or lower ranks in Qing Dynasty were distinguished by bird and animal patterns on clothes , Taiping Heavenly Kingdom used the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different ranks , and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different positions , all of which can be traced to the same origin .
I do n't care how much Wang Shi wastes every time he climbs a mountain , but I do strongly despise how he talks and the way he acts during this whole thing .
After donating , he suggested that charity should not be the burden of businesses , and therefore stipulated that his company 's employee donations should not exceed 10 yuan .
Totally absurd logic . Wang Shi 's reasoning is that making donations to charities then the burden of businesses could cause companies to fail in market competition ;
But we can see such philanthropists as Bill Gates , Li Ka - shing , Jackie Chan have not affected the growth of their enterprises in any way . Instead , they have actually increased the competitiveness of their companies .
And there were some netizens who hit back in the Wang Shi donations issue by admonishing us for forcing donations on moral grounds .
Exactly ! An excellent justification !
If you say that netizens rebuking Wang Shi is forcing donations , then what kind of behavior is Wang Shi preventing employees from donating more than 10 yuan ?
Wang Shi is the economic version of a cold - blooded animal , and we do n't care ,
but how come Wang Shi , how come he wants to restrict what employees do or do n't do on moral grounds ?
This really is a case of one rule for some , another rule for everyone else !!!
We see , as at May 17 , the Chinese government has accepted up to 6 billion in disaster - relief donations domestically and internationally , of which 4.8 billion is from domestic donors .
What we can see now are merely the name and figure of each donor constantly listed in what is like an honor roll .
Yet unfortunately , we do n't have more detailed information of the whereabouts and specific uses of the donated funds .
As corruption has long been prevalent among local governments and economic auditing is not transparent enough , disaster - relief funds are often appropriated , exhausted , expropriated and embezzled .
Therefore , once such a huge amount of disaster - relief funds from people the world and China are embezzled or otherwise partially transferred by local officials , the resulting political damage and lowering of the government 's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government 's disaster - relief efforts .
If the donations are directly put in the hands of disaster - hit people , it would push local prices higher , driving the already high inflation to a direction that is even harder to regulate .
It is said that our country 's earthquake forecasting is at an advanced level in the world .
But the glory of the earthquake workers did not produce good luck for the departed spirits of Wenchuan .
So , we again hear expert figures emphasizing once again , " Earthquake forecasts are a global challenge that so far no one has been able to solve . "
Consequently , we come to realize that the academic laurels for " the success rates of predictions of impending earthquakes that have already reached almost 40 % " are just conditions and capital used to apply for funding , evaluate professional titles and seek remuneration , rather than a hard rationale used to reduce bloodshed and deaths .
We should offer earthquake workers our full understanding .
Facing the caprice of nature , humankind is really insignificant .
Furthermore , although our sense of security increases with each passing day in line with " significant advances achieved " in seismology , we can not look to anyone to give us any promises .
Because , once someone has made a promise , he would be doomed thereafter to bear this bloody weight of " being unable to effectively avoid earthquake disasters . "
And by not issuing any promises , he could actually avoid being censured .
Because " there is no way to make predictions " !
Humans can manufacture tanks that are much more powerful than ants , but humans can not manufacture a living ant ...
However advanced instruments manufactured by humans are , their level of complexity can not compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .
Do not regard earthquake prediction as a " practical skill " ; rather regard it as academic work in a study .
Take no notice of the real results in terms of preventing earthquakes or minimizing disasters ; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embodied in " prediction success rates . "
In the course of major disaster warnings , too many disputes relating to powers and interests are entangled .
The directions of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization are just confined to research into the phenomenon of earthquakes , but efforts to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise building standards , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanisms and other aspects have been neglected .... .
We have also become blindly abreast of foreign countries even in earthquake research : we do n't believe in living beings raised as part of nature ; we just believe in the instruments we ourselves manufacture .
We do n't believe the warnings sent out by nature ; we just believe the warnings emitted by instruments in laboratories .
We do n't believe in what is seen and heard with their own eyes by millions of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusions of experts and scholars .
Chinese seismology is galloping down the wrong road .
Real estate is only one part of the national economy but the real estate phenomenon exists in every sector of the national economy .
The swift large - scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprises and state - owned enterprises is proof of this .
Things have reached the step where the national television station has to set up a stage with the country 's military singers , high - class singers , as well as top - of - the - line celebrities from all walks of life singing to folks like Wang Shi for donations .
We should n't be too bothered if folks like Wang Shi say something unpleasant .
A defeated general ca n't claim to be brave .
In front of folks like Wang Shi , the State Council are all defeated generals .
Because the missing - in - action army who built New China have been beaten to a pulp by folks like Wang Shi ; even if China has no earthquakes , there will be floods , as well as SARS , snowstorms , big freezes etc.
China is a land of many catastrophes - this has always been true and always will be .
Relying on singing for donations , entertaining for one 's supper , will not solve the problem .
And time and time again asking the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag , carrying on like this in the name of the country is outrageous , it 's the State Council 's problem .
All the people with one mind " as the national anthem is inspired by the foresight of " always being prepared " , designed for " advance , advance , advance , enter ! " instead of being designed for repeated begging , pleading for donations , and fund - raising .
From leaders to the common people , everyone needs to keep that in mind .
When we go back to the 10th Century AD , we find that the 10th Century AD gave birth to the first entrepreneurs .
Because the 10th Century AD was the very time when limited liability companies were established ; the Catholic Pope of the time had such a conviction during the 9th Century .
Are you afraid of going to Hell when you die ?
Yes , you are afraid - how could you not go just because you are afraid ?
Donate your property to the Church , show your loyalty to God and you wo n't go to Hell ,
so a lot of rich people donated their money to the Church before they died .
By the 10th Century AD , 60 % of Britain 's territory belonged to the Church ,
but their clergymen could n't manage it , and were unable to pass it on to the next generation . What could they do ?
So they set up the modern limited liability company .
How did they set it up ?
They hired professional managers to run these Church enterprises ,
these professional managers were the administrators ,
And who were the proprietors of these companies ?
The Church .
So what did this confirm ?
The first step in separating the administration rights from ownership ,
in no way because this was a great system , but rather that this was inevitable within the Church enterprises .
When forecasting earthquakes , why did it happen that only a few cases were successful while most cases were failures ?
According to this writer 's many years of research on precursory signs , the existence of precursory signs and earthquake predictions are two issues that are both connected and mutual differentiated .
The appearance of a precursory sign does n't mean it can accurately forecast the three elements of an earthquake , because precursory signs are extremely complicated .
There are certain differences in the categories , breadths , distribution ranges , and duration of precursory signs of different types of earthquakes in different places .
In " Regional Nature of Precursory Signs of Earthquakes , " this writer divides earthquakes into two major types according to the overall characteristics of pre - earthquake signs : strike - type and slip - type earthquakes .
The former occurs in areas where internal fault blocks or fault lines converge but not intersect , while the latter occurs in active fault lines .
Strike - type earthquakes have various types of precursory signs , which are widespread , long - lasting , and quite variable .
Slip - type earthquakes have fewer types of precursory signs , which have a smaller distribution range , shorter duration period , and smaller range of change .
In Chengdu , which is over 100 kms away from the epicenter , the earthquake should not have an intensity of over 7 , or 8 at the most .
There should not be any safety problems for Class A buildings like those at the airport , hospitals and schools that are designed to withstand a intensity of 8 .
So most buildings in Chengdu should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizens may go home reassured .
If not so , an investigation should be conducted for any jerry - built projects .
If large sums of money have been spent to provide protection , yet it fails to work when the earthquake comes ,
such that nobody dares to live at home , is able to use hospitals , or accesses airports , then has the money been thrown for nothing ?
Probably some would say the national building criteria for earthquake resistance was enacted in recent years , and older buildings may not comply with the requirements .
However , at the same time the government enacted the earthquake resistance criteria , it required all existing buildings which did not satisfy the criteria to be reinforced and removed of dangers in a timely fashion .
Thus one can not shirk responsibilities on excuse that it is an old building .
In addition , the government also has criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural buildings .
The earthquake in Sichuan stuns everyone .
Elementary school buildings collapsed , and children were buried in the rubble .
Middle school buildings collapsed , and young students were buried under the crumbled walls .
Kindergarten buildings also collapsed , and little children 's frail bodies fell helplessly next to the crumbled walls where they closed their innocent eyes forever .
We could n't help crying at this sorrowful scene .
Children are the flowers of our motherland and future of our motherland .
These flowers of life died early in a natural disaster .
Natural disasters can not be predicted , but the school buildings should not have collapsed .
Why are the buildings behind the school buildings still there while the school buildings where children studied collapsed from the first floor to the fourth floor leaving only crumbled walls ?
Children , you should n't have departed like this .
Every year , all levels of People 's Congress are held from local governments to the Central Government .
Deputies to the People 's Congress , please make an all - around inspection of school buildings in all areas and inspect whether or not the school buildings in your constituencies are up to local earthquake - resistance standards , and then quickly make a proposal according to the existing problems and push each level of the government to complete rectifications and improvements within a limited time .
Special legislation in the National People 's Congress on construction of school buildings should be proposed .
There needs to be special legal procedures for the design , materials , construction , completion , and inspection of the school buildings to ensure that top priority be given to quality and durability .
Allowing all children to study safely is the sacred and bounden duty of the People 's Congress .
In June 1976 , 83 year - old Mao Zedong had already been revived once after suffering a myocardial infarction .
To get effective care for his condition , the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP established a special treatment team , in charge of his medical treatment and care .
The Political Bureau also specifically assigned people to the task of Mao Zedong 's medical care , taking turns with the doctors and nurses to be on constant vigil at his living quarters .
On the day of the Tangshan Earthquake , i.e. July 28th , those on duty at Mao Zedong 's quarters were Wang Dongxing , Wang Hongwen , and Mao Zedong 's confidential secretary , Zhang Yufeng .
In the early hours of the morning , with the clock hands pointing to 3:42 , the ground of Zhongnanhai suddenly started to shudder .
In Mao Zedong 's residence , the glass window in the foyer door rattled uncontrollably , and there was a huge bang from below like a tractor starting up , with Mao Zedong 's sickbed shaking non - stop .......
While Mao Zedong was convalescing , the employees and medical staff around him were all in a state of high tension , maintaining extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere .
In normal times , apart from the talking and noise of medical instruments when the doctors revived him , not a whisper could be heard .
After the nineties , state - owned engineering enterprises stopped recruiting construction workers .
But that is n't to say they stopped hiring people , but those they took in were all graduates with professional diplomas from polytechnic schools , technical colleges , and universities ; these staff all went into management .
During the early nineties , the formal employees of this enterprise still had complete working teams , such as bricklaying teams , woodwork teams , steel reinforcement teams , and machinery maintenance teams , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project tasks , they were already cooperating with some migrant worker units , in other words the familiar " contracting gangs " .
A collision occurred between tradition and reality .
Due to formal working units no longer taking on young employees , working units got increasingly older and broken up .
Some staff ( extremely few ) entered management .
A few exceptional former team leaders gradually became project managers .
Others became materials officers , safety officers and quality control officers , etc.
Those without connections became staff monitoring the construction site ------ similar to the security guards of today .
The workers no longer formed complete operating teams .
And at this time , migrant worker units gained an opportunity to develop .
The entire on - site operation work was all carried out by contracting gangs .
Working units disbanded .
The status of these workers was also changing .
The corrupt mentality that treating dinner and gift - giving is necessary for getting things done is deeply rooted in the minds of people from all walks of society .
In each case of corruption , those power - wielding bureaucrats , those scholars or technicians who have cornered the market in their fields , those capitalists with vast wealth , they are the ruling force of this society , and also the ones who profit from the corruption .
The powerless , pennyless working public with no access to information technology resources % PW are the ones who lose out from the corruption .
Today 's society is corrupt in every direction , and the direct cause is the reinstatement of private ownership and the scrapping of the public supervision of the Mao Zedong era .
In privatized societies , everybody tramples over others trying to maximize their own interests .
Doctors who do n't receive ' red envelopes ' have no motivation to properly cure the patient .
Teachers openly ask students to give them gifts ,
gang ringleaders use cash to have the media make them out as heroes ,
capitalists trying to annex state - owned property team up with scholars and academically demonstrate state - owned monopolies to be the reason behind corruption , and then reap in the profits .
Frequently the public , under the guidance of the mainstream media , only concern themselves with administrative and judicial corruption ; this in itself is a type of corruption .
Do commodity prices have a base value worth talking about ?
Do commodities have a true value ?
These are already elements of uncertainty .
With things , less is more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .
In fact , in a socialist country one can not act in that way .
In the area of profiting from commodities , there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms , there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be , or what percentage .
China 's self - sufficient , natural economy was not without any advantages . At least it did n't try to reap large profits off its own people ,
now the exact opposite is the case .
A home appliance - whether you are Chinese or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you are a big city or a small city , whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price .
Not knowing how much profit is in there , not caring who can afford it and who ca n't , these do not seem to be the principles of socialism .
And with farmers ' grain and rural products , if the country does n't wipe out agricultural taxes and does n't offer any subsidies , keeping on producing is a problem .
In order to improve the people 's living standards , the government set things so that grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people .
With this kind of ratio in existence , in struggling areas trying for a comfortable life is very difficult .
This issue should attract the close attention of economists .
December 26 , 1975 , Mao Zedong had his 82th birth day , his last one .
Upon turning 80 , Mao Zedong felt apparently that he was old and would die soon .
Therefore , around his birthday those few years , Mao Zedong had always talked about life and death from time to time .
One thing he often said was : " 73 and 84 are ages at which you will be gone even if the King of Hell does n't call you . "
Also since he turned 80 , people had been paying more and more attention to Mao Zedong 's birthday .
Within the country , people dared not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .
Local governments dared not present gifts to Mao Zedong , but would convey their blessings to Mao Zedong in various ways .
In the years before Mao Zedong passed away , his hometown Hunan would specially send things like long life noodles on December 26 every year .
For this , Mao Zedong had accepted with pleasure , which was quite unusual .
Despite Microsoft 's status as the globe 's most financially endowed high - tech leader , bargaining with Microsoft is something that is sure to leave you greatly disillusioned .
Microsoft 's dictionary has never contained the word " generous " .
So when the Jerry Yangs hope that by bargaining they can bump up Microsoft 's purchase price , they are being very unrealistic .
Microsoft raising its price ever so slightly already represented a big concession , proving that it really does want to get its hands on Yahoo ! .
Ultimately choosing to give it up was obviously a very painful decision for Microsoft .
Right from the start , this was a super acquisition that lacked bite ; despite the numbers being huge , even if the acquisition was successful , truly revolutionizing the framework of the Internet was simply not possible .
However , when the acquisition did fall through , it was also quite disappointing .
To us global observers watching the bustling scene , giving up the acquisition was like a play stopped abruptly halfway through , without ever getting the chance to watch the rest of the fun , and indeed there was no shortage of theatrical transformations .
We have no choice but to return back to our mundane lives , and wait for this increasingly passion - destroying industry to come up with the next affair of note .
Since last September , when his daughter was diagnosed with symptoms such as bloody feces and kidney stones , Zhou Jin has been in succession to Yongzhou in Hunan , Hebei , Xiamen , Beijing , Guangzhou , and more to take his daughter to hospitals for treatment , but the child 's illness has continued to improve and decline .
This September , Zhou Jin , working in Shenzhen , took his daughter to the Shenzhen Children 's Hospital for examination and treatment .
The results of the examination are that the upper rectum was severely infected and the right kidney expanded . The kidney stone found in previous hospital treatments was not found this time .
Zhou Jin said that his daughter , a little over two years old this year , had eaten Sanlu milk powder for over a year . Last September after the bloody feces appeared , family members took his daughter to the Yongzhou hospital for examination . The doctors informed them that " there is no better treatment method , just have her drink more water . "
Worrying about his daughter 's illness , Zhou Jin asked the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital , to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment .
The hospital Medical Administration Department told Zhou Jin that issuing of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the Ministry of Health , and more than one month would be needed .
" I went repeatedly to find the relevant health department , but they passed my case back and forth . I was helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where I work -- Xiamen , to carry out treatment . "
Have to suffer this pain .
The doctor in charge told us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate .
Getting him to urinate could n't be more difficult !
This urine is more valuable than gold .
He did n't pee at all during the first two or three days in hospital .
We were all desperate at that time .
The hospital already arranged for him to undergo dialysis surgery .
And my satisfying son finally urinated .
Out of danger at last , but one trouble passed and another one took its place , there came an acute diarrhea and fever , he was stooling several dozen times every day , you can imagine the suffering .
He had just danced a circle around the Grim Reaper , and encounted this problem on top of that . I was really worried he would n't pull through .
I do n't know what was happening with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they injected him the worse the diarrhea , nothing would stop it .
After a few more days of treatment , the kid 's diarrhea was a little better and the doctors got him to do an ultrasound .
The kidney stone had been washed out by the medicine . There were no more stones on his kidneys .
The hospitalization was very expensive and our family could n't afford it , so we had no choice but to leave the hospital and go home .
On the night of Dragon Boat Festival he passed out a stone by himself , it was a sedimentary one .
The whole family was really excited , we all thought he was better , that he was cured .
Over 200 Han pupils in 15th primary school in Urumqi were injected , * and there were actually Uyghur students from the same schools involved * , it was shocking !
On the day of September 1st alone , at the entrance of " Longyuan Supermarket " on Urumqi 's Friendship Road , two people were injected and sent to hospital .
On the same day , in Shuimogou District , No. 106 Bus had just pulled up at the Gaojiazhuang stop when several people were injected , soon , the Uyghur assailants jumped from the bus and fled , but they were soon detained after bystanders gave chase .
The 920 and many other buses also experienced a number of poisoned syringe cases .
On August 31 , the No. 17 bus exploded near Xibei Road , while the No. 14 bus was bombed at the same time .
Nevertheless , all news was blocked .
But witnesses shortly after spread the news to the outside world by telephone - Urumqi security is extremely deteriorating !
Even more ironic was in late August , when * President Hu Jintao * had just visited Xinjiang on an inspection tour . Upon his return to Beijing , the situation in Urumqi was far from settling , instead the * Uyghur terrorists * becoming even more rampant , and the numbers of attacks and bombings were increasing rather than decreasing !
The incompetence of the Xinjiang government would make the Central extremely troublesome !
Listening to Yesterday Once More by the Carpenters , seeing the photograph album in which photos showing collages of compatriots receiving awards , I do n't know when people should cry , and my heart is lost .
After so many years can they still sing Yesterday Once More ?
Dear friends , let me fill in some of the words for the melody right now in my heart .
Do n't worry , the cold - blood is n't me , it 's a part of my heart .
If an Olympic Games were held taking the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme , I think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of winning the grand total in gold medals . I just do n't know how the opening ceremony would be run , how volunteers should be recruited , or which song should be sung lustily .
The title of the sick man of East Asia once went far away following the revolutionary course brimming with victories , but after seeing this group of photos , I feel that they have whistled back with this brand new attitude of faster , higher , stronger .
What is different is that I dare not expect for ; in what way can we have again " The Destruction of Opium at Humen " with " upholding the country 's interests with one 's life " .
Because we and our motherland can not depart from this shocking pollution . What we can do is just to improve , adjust and vaguely hope .
The people who have been sacrificed have , without choice , used their lives to pave the road to success for another group of people .
At that time , tens of thousands of city youth headed to the countryside , but by no means were all of them were true believers .
Some were under pressure to show their " revolutionary zeal " , others went because there were no jobs in the city .
The poverty and backwardness of the countryside were appalling , and most of the educated youth became disillusioned .
In the middle of the 1970 's the intensity of the Cultural Revolution waned , and one after one the youths returned to the cities or went to study in university , but back then there was n't an exam to get into university , it depended on your political background and behavior .
Jianguo was not one of these . He worked for seven years in a rural part of Inner Mongolia , became a village head , and was very popular with the locals .
He was a dab hand at working the fields , and could match the locals when it came to drinking spirits .
He married an old school friend of his from Beijing , and she stayed behind for him , the two living their own little lives together in the country .
Although the villagers had no interest in the various kinds of " revolutionary practices " that Jianguo tried to make them adopt , he was honest and kind , and his generous personality won their friendship and affection .
After Jianguo had returned to Beijing for not even a few moths , the student movement in Tiananmen began .
Jianguo went to the square to listen to speeches and singing , and watched a new generation of students be rebellious , and was shaken and moved .
Twenty years before , the god of the " Red Guards " was Mao , but the ideal of young people now was wearing jeans and a T - shirt , and a new statue had been erected : Lady Liberty .
At that time I lived in Beijing , and every day went to the square . When we ran into each other , Jianguo did n't say much . However it looked like he had a million thoughts stirring in his heart .
One afternoon , I went to see an active figure in the square , and arranged to go together with him .
Friends greeted me with smiles , and asked me to go into their tent , as a meeting of student leaders was going on inside .
Jianguo was just behind me and had just started to come inside , when my friends frowned and stopped him : " No , you ca n't come inside ! "
I explained , saying this was my brother . My friends listened with surprise .
Beijing - born and Beijing - raised Jianguo , he looked today completely like a villager from the countryside .
Wang Peirong thinks that this is related to blockages in the usual reporting channels .
He pointed out , all of his reports were made under the circumstances that the normal reports did n't work , and he had no choice but made reports online .
A typical example is that the fall of Dong Feng , the most debaucherous secretary labeled as one - husband - with - two - wife in the country .
Wang Peirong thinks that Dong Feng 's absurdity and corruption was actually an open secret , but nobody investigated and penalized ; and even though Wang Peirong reported on this using his real name to the concerned departments for one year , no one bothered to inquire about it .
Wang Peirong also thinks that reporting online is equivalent to publicizing the corruptive deeds of the person being reported against . Once under the public eye , the possibility of any blatant cover - ups becomes greatly reduced , thus , making it easier to investigate and penalize .
Many people will ask , Chargeback Rival is made by an individual , so what is the relationship with 360 ?
There are likely three original reasons why 360 uses a person 's name to issue Chargeback Rival :
General manager Zhou has done too much bad stuff on PC 's , and did n't want to offend too many people on cell phones , so he found an individual author to act as a scapegoat ( if a cell phone SP company knew that it was 360 that block their way . Each one of them is tough . ) ;
Using an individual author to issue it , it was easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy .
If you see I am an individual netizen , who has been charged money , so makes a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem , then how moved it seems from the outside .
Using an individual author to issue , there has been a strong power of captivation . Many companies in the SP and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence , so would not pay too much attention to it .
Nevertheless , 360 already did this under cover of promoting Chargeback Rival in large scale . Once after Chargeback Rival became dominant on the situation , then it is to be transformed into 360 .
Having seen no hope from Xu Ming , Wang Peirong then could only post the relevant problems online .
Not only that , Wang Peirong 's generous and courageous endeavors have led to revenge from the reported on numerous occasions : when reporting the corruption of Li Rongqi , he was severely beaten up by hired goons ; when reporting the black forces , he was retaliated by the black forces , and hospitalized for the injuries .
But these have not been able to halt the momentum of Wang Peirong 's reporting .
However , in the program , Wang Peirong calls out to the parties and the government to set out policies and provisions to protect the personal safety and legal rights of whistle blowers .
This program of << News Night Banquet >> on Jiangsu TV 's city channel , caused a great uproar in the community .
But in contrast with this , Wang Peirong , well reputed as Jiangsu 's " number one person in online anti - corruption " , is now suffering unfair treatment .
Because of pressure from the reported officials such as Li Rongqi , China 's University of Mining and Technology has suspended Wang Peirong 's teaching duties .
How China University of Mining and Technology responds to Jiangsu mainstream media 's positive and active appraisal of Wang Peirong ; how well they treat Wang Peirong ; and how they protect Wang Peirong 's legal rights , are unavoidable questions placed in front of the Mining University 's decision makers .
The Chinese defense budget for 2012 is RMB 670.274 billion , increasing by RMB 67.604 billion and 11.2 % compared to the previous year 's estimated budgetary expenditure .
The Chinese military expenditures are increasing too fast for America , and the increase is currently over RMB 100 billion , but what on earth can China do with this additional amount of more than RMB 100 billion dollars ?
Based on the current exchange rate between the Renminbi and US dollar , it amounts to more than US$ 10 billion , which can purchase more than a hundred of the latest 3.5 generation Western fighter planes .
If it is used to manufacture Chinese J - 10 fighters , over two hundred planes can be produced , or perhaps even more . In one go , China can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid - sized Western country .
In fact , what America really fears is not the increase of military expenditure , but rather the rapid rate at which China is upgrading its military technologies , which may enable China to overtake America soon .
Compared to America , China has many inadequacies , for instance , its high technology development is not as mature as America 's , and its basic infrastructure , the standard of education of its citizens , development of its systems and so on are also lacking . However , China has its own natural advantages , and that is China possesses a long history and stability of culture .
Some people pointed out in their comments that this is a serious disadvantage to China when compared to America , as they say that China is carrying too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development ,
in fact , this reasoning is extremely incorrect , the Chinese culture is profound , so whatever problems the country may face , it can draw on its historic experiences ,
for instance , when China deals with international affairs , it can learn from how the Yuan Dynasty handled foreign trade and the problems of co - existence between multiple ethnic groups , or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experiences .
Currently America is drastically cutting down on its military expenditure , however it fears that China will substantially increase its military expenditure . America is desperately attempting to return to the Pacific Ocean as it wishes to continue to contain the growth of Chinese military strength ,
America controls the Straits of Malacca , and a large majority of China 's shipping vessels are under its control . However if America wishes to maintain the development of world trade order , its expenses will naturally be enormous .
If it were not for the financial crisis , a number of Western countries have stated that they would not have considered budgetary issues for American military deployments .
As a matter of fact , neighboring countries need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in Chinese military spending . They fear that China will pose a direct threat to them , but Chinese history has shown that China has never had the habit of wielding its military might to challenge Western countries , but as for how they habitually view China will depend on the profound influence of the Chinese culture .
China does not like to show off , preferring to restrain itself , and the same is true in the field of military matters .
Up to now , China revealed that it has three models of the 4th generation stealth fighter planes under research and development , and the J 20 is expected to enter mass production and service next year , which is a direct blow to America ,
however , what is even more terrifying for America is that this Chinese fighter plane model has already displayed surprisingly advanced performance during combat , and it is feared that its level of technological advancement can not be matched by the F 22. After all , this model of fighter plane has never participated in actual inspections up to this point .
Perhaps this is understandable for China , but it is inevitable that the 4th generation Chinese fighter plane would create a stir .
The original order has been disrupted . After all , the Chinese fighter is no less powerful than the American one .
According to American media reports , China 's military expenditures are expected to reach US$ 200 billion in two years ' time ,
Of course there is a strong possibility that this number has been greatly exaggerated , and it is also embellished by the China Threat theory . However , such moves by America no longer has much effect on China , even if the Chinese defense expenditures reach US$ 200 billion , America can not do anything to China ,
Recently , China adopted an aggressive stance , casting negative votes on the Syria issue three times , and in relation to Japan 's naming of the Diaoyu Islands , Beijing appears to be sending a message that ' we have accumulated sufficient power , and we are not afraid of your distortions of the truth . '
The Chinese military expenditures are soaring . By contrast , America is continuously cutting down on its military expenditures , repeatedly asserting that its prowess will be replaced by small but elite troops that will not affect its capabilities . As it is nothing more than self - consolation , therefore , it caused widespread concern throughout America .
Certainly , this is clearly a refurbished version of the ' military threat theory ' from America , and it is now changed to a ' threat by military expenditure theory ' , however , China is used to finger - wagging and criticism from America , and as China grows increasingly confident , this writer believes that America will terminate its friendly economic relations with China soon or later ,
China 's soaring military expenditures imply that China is reluctant to be limited to a position as the world 's No. 2 , and nor is it content to be world No. 1 in name only . Instead , it intends to recover its historical 1,500 - year glory as the leader of the world .
The content is not quite the same as the title ...
Let me whisper this : Doing business in America depends on connections , and red packets are also accepted ~ same as in China ... :)
Faced with rascals and hooligans like the Americans , the Chinese have no choice but to arm themselves .
Indeed . I wonder what our military expenditure is like in proportion to America 's , and besides how much of our military expenditure is genuinely spent on sophisticated national defenses , if it is really spent on advanced defenses , there will never be such a thing as too much ! Compared to America we are still lagging far behind !
Now that Vice President Xi has visited America , the direction for the Sino - American relationship has become the focus of world attention .
But no matter how sweetly imperialist America talks , I have no hope for imperialist America .
Imperialist America has always been a country failing to live up to its words , and as long as something is in its interests , it will spare no effort and use any means to get it .
The relationship between China and imperialist America is like that between the sheep and the wolf , and do n't expect the wolf to change its ambition ,
the wolf and the sheep can never be friends , even if so , it 's only an illusion on our part , it 's only a wolf in sheep 's clothing .
Ultimately , it will reveal its wolf nature , and I hope the sheep will not be fooled by it .
The whole world expects China and America to coexist peacefully , jointly preside over and deal with international affairs , and build a peaceful new international order .
The peaceful coexistence of China and America is also the common wish of the people in the two countries .
Nevertheless , the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish .
China is the fallen petals that have the intention , but imperialist America is the heartless flowing water .
Maintaining friendly relations with imperialist America is only the wishful thinking of some Chinese !
Though there is a great distance between China and America and there are no territorial disputes , unlike our relationship with the Polar Bear , there is a direct conflict of interest .
However , due to ideological difference between China and America and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handling international affairs , it is particularly imperialist America , in its effort to contain the development of China and its threat to its hegemonic position , that makes trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the Chinese dragon .
Actually , imperialist America has the initiative in terms of whether the two major countries , China and America can get along ,
China has done a lot , and sacrificed a lot , for the Sino - American relationship ,
out of its wishful thinking , China uses its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist America , but it is still unable to win imperialistic America 's sincerity , causing the Sino - American relationship to waver and even fall backwards .
In future times , as China challenges its world hegemony and imperialist America attempts to retain it , more clashes will happen , conflicts will be inevitable , and the struggle will become ever more ferocious .
In recent years , as China 's reform and opening - up campaign has reached greater depths , the people 's living standards have improved substantially , and its defense and military strength has also developed rapidly .
The status of China as a major world power has begun to be more prominent , and in dealing with and directing international affairs , China has played an ever more important role .
China 's rapid growth and rise has gradually threatened and challenged the hegemonic position of imperialist America .
This makes imperialist America restless , and it has devised every possible means to contain and check China 's development .
Imperialist America wants to upset and restrain China with its military sales to Taiwan and the Taiwan issue !
The Taiwan issue has become an everlasting sorrow in the hearts of all descendants of China .
Imperialist America wants to control the Middle East and suppress Syria and Iran mainly because it covets the important strategic location and abundant resources of the Middle East .
Imperialist America wants to overthrow the Bashar regime to get rid of the Polar Bear 's only military base in the Middle East ! It does not want the influence of the Polar Bear to exist in the Middle East region over the long term .
Imperialist America wants to topple Iran mainly to take on China , to control China 's resources and contain China 's development .
In addition , it also wants to suppress the Polar Bear and squeeze the living space of China and Russia .
In today 's world , the only countries that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist America are China and , to a lesser degree , the Polar Bear .
Imperialist America has had far - reaching strategic foresight , and each step it takes serves to consolidate its hegemony .
Imperialist America is suppressing China in an all - round way , and we can see imperialist America 's meddling presence in the economy , politics and military affairs .
Imperialist America has been supporting little Japan , India , the Philippine servants and the Vietnamese monkeys , disturbing the stable environment around China to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of China .
Imperialist America is now pompously returning to the Asia Pacific region and reshuffling its military deployment , directly targeting China .
Taiwan is the deepest pain for all Chinese , because imperialist America has long taken Taiwan as a pawn and used it as a bargaining chip in the struggle with China .
It 's a pity that many Chinese are still hoping to make friends with imperialist America and maintain a friendship with imperialist America from generation to generation .
Furthermore , the many strategic adjustments and ideas of imperialist America are all aimed at the rising China .
Many advanced weapons have been tailor - made for China .
Compatriots ! Wake up ! Imperialist America has already aimed its guns to our heads , do not keep daydreaming !
Imperialist America takes China as its prime rival and enemy , give up your fantasy that you can make friends with the enemy !
The best method is to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction , cast away all the illusions , and get ready for war !
Our ancestors wisely said , " Harbor no ill intention against others , but never relax one 's vigilance " !
This is the necessary psychology for getting along with friends , but at this moment imperialist America is our enemy staring like a tiger watching its prey , making it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time !
China has made a lot of sacrifices to improve its relations with imperialist America , and China has all along tried to become friends with imperialist America ,
although China now needs a peaceful and stable environment for its development , we ca n't make continual investments without any return .
Can Sino - American relations be improved ? Is friendly development possible ? The key question lies with imperialist America , not China .
Imperialist America has always held the initiative in the development of Sino - American relations .
In fact , it is not difficult for China and America to become friends , because China and America , despite their ideological differences , have no land or territorial disputes .
Though China and America have fought each other on the battlefield , the wars were not directly between China and America .
If imperialist America sincerely wants to make friends with China , it must display its sincerity and let the Chinese people see actual actions and results .
For China , the greatest interest concerning imperialist America lies in the Taiwan issue .
If imperialist America can stop its military sales to Taiwan , provide no support to Taiwan , and ensure peace across the Taiwan Straits , it will allow China to accomplish its great cause of national reunification .
If it refrains from meddling in China 's internal human rights issues , and also does not intervene in other affairs such as Tibet , I believe that China will also sacrifice its other interests to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist America !
Only if imperialist America does this can China and America truly become friends and co - exist peacefully as friends from generation to generation .
Will imperialist America give up Taiwan ? Absolutely not !
Being used to being a hegemon , imperialist America likes to intervene in the internal affairs and human rights affairs of other countries , and Taiwan is the best chess piece for containing China , so I believe imperialist America will not easily let go of it !
There is even less possibility that it will tolerate a Chinese challenge to its position as the world hegemon !
In the years to come , instead of becoming friends , China and America will only become rivals and even enemies !
Therefore , it 's unnecessary to harbor any fantasies about imperialist America , China should fundamentally change its mentality , there is no need to fear imperialist America , and we should be ready for a military confrontations with imperialist America at any time .
Let 's win the respect of imperialist America and the whole world with our strength .
A peaceful rise is only our unilateral notion , because the big powers of the world will not accept the appearance of a powerful China .
Only baptized by war can China really become a world power .
The Chinese should be ever vigilant and not be deceived by the present peace , active war preparation is the only right choice ,
only when our defense and military have become strong , will we be able to eradicate all aggressors , and only through the baptism of war can China become a truly powerful country .
In my personal opinion , there must be a war between China and America in the future !
What China needs to do is to cast away its illusions and get ready for war .
China Mobile is no doubt a monopolized operator in China , the biggest mobile phone market in the world . It has also expressed clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competitions .
Even though the performances of Chinese companies are not outstanding in the course of globalization , Wang Jianzhou , President and CEO of China Mobile , is determined to change all this .
On the eve of the Business Week CEO Forum held in Beijing on November 1 , Wang Jianzhou gave an exclusive interview to the editor of the Business Week .
He stated that the objective of China Mobile is to become a world - class company .
Wang Jianzhou , 57 , said in fluent English that China Mobile , which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , has close to 300 million mobile phone users in mainland China , an equivalent of the entire population of the United States .
This signifies that China Mobile occupies almost 70 percent of the market share in mainland China .
Li Yanhong , Zhang Chaoyang , Shen Nanpeng , Ma Huateng ...
In the past 10 years , behind these Chinese high - tech magnates who emerged one after another was sure to be the shadow of the U.S. owned International Data Group ( IDG ) .
The annual IDG Conference was held in Sanya , Hainan on November 3 .
Apart from the seven partners , who are called the ' Seven Swords ' inside IDG , the participants also included over 190 CEOs of companies that IDG invested in and representatives from investment banks and consulting agencies .
According to the practice of the past six years , after each IDG conference , there will always be some participants who make the list of magnates of the year .
I insisted on not paying him . Finally , he cracked and fled in panic .
However , I was also at the verge of collapse because the people 's police at 110 whom I looked forward to still had not arrived yet .
These days , overseas study has become popular . To friends and relatives , it 's a proud thing to be mentioned .
Children of the rich and government officials , who does n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?
Let alone that getting oneself a western diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future . Even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
However , those in middle class families or even laid - off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future ( they do n't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees ) . How wonderful ! Thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
It seems that once they are sent overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
Nowadays , it is more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas . With a bit of " toughening up " , everything will be okay .
Wrong ! With a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .
Even more frightening is that it holds the child back .
I 've been in France for several years !
What I have experienced myself or , even more , what I have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .
Overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
Life is never a bed of roses in any location , even more in a foreign land where there is a language barrier , different customs and no family or friends .
Malformed society
The proposal on " the transfer of reproduction rights " is originate from the same track the proposal on " controlling the number of rural children going to college " ! What else are these representatives if not do - nothing politicians ?
Fuck you ! Go to hell ! Fuck your mother !
Complete and obvious bullshit ! More sinister than directly selling and buying infants !
Can China still be saved ?
The one - child policy is the most insidious policy , thoroughly antihuman and racially discriminatory , an open trampling on the right of survival right for Han people as a whole . Those who formulated and implemented this policy are all fascists ; they should be brought to trial at the International Court , and the people principally responsible for it should be hanged .
This guy really is a " representative " , a - ha .
As known to all , Shanghai and Hong Kong have very low birth rates and mainly depend on migrants to maintain their population sizes and keep their populations young ; there is good economic development ;
In recent years , due to labor shortages , millions of black people and Southeast Asians have come to the southeast , and have caused varied degrees of deterioration in social order .
Just like Shanghai and Hong Kong , China depends on immigrants and at the same time pursues the one - child policy , making the planning policy look like a very clever policy !
Shanghai and Hong Kong maintain their social development by absorbing migrants from other provinces , what will happen if China prepares herbal medicine by the prescribed method and absorbs foreigners ?
Do n't wait till the situation has become unmanageable and then drive away the gypsies as Sarkozy did ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just recently declared that Germany has failed to build a diversified society and will limit the development of the immigrant population ; now that the sheep have been stolen , no choice but to mend the fold !
Before long , the dividends for the population would wear out . As immigrant laborers swarmed in ( these people are not subject to family planning ) , the population would soon experience racial replacement , and China , as Yugoslavia did , would soon disintegrate !
The blacks , Arabs , and Vietnamese , one after another , would demand their rights , autonomy , and independence !
One after another , the local areas would become independent , as Kosovo did !
The minority peoples in Xinjiang and Tibet can bear more children , causing the proportion of the Han people compared to the population of the frontier ethnic regions to decline quickly ;
The regiments of troops and Sichuan women that such national heroes as Zuo Zongtang and Wang Zhen took great pains to transplant into Xinjiang and Tibet are being quickly exterminated by the one - child policy ; the undercurrents of Xinjiang Independence and Tibetan Independence are getting ever more rampant !
The family planning policy and the one - child policy have put the country in an dangerous as stacking eggs , and posed a threat to the survival of the nation .
Family planning has effectively reduced the Chinese population by 300 million , postponing the Day of 7 Billion by 3 years ; According to the plan of the Planning Commission , even if the Chinese population is reduced by 1 billion , the Day of 7 Billion will be postponed for just another few years !
But the Chinese nation will be on the brink of extinction . Such selfless notions which nobody will have until evolving into a nonhuman creature , surprisingly , has become a reality in China !
The issues of population and ethnical structure are major issues for the survival of the country !
Family planning is part of the plan to massively exterminate the Han people , and the beginning of dividing China !
The family planning policy is extremely stupid and the ultimate in self - castration . It is unprecedented from a historic perspective and will be unmatchable in the future ; and in the global perspective , it is totally unique !
The self - harming policy fully embodies the malice of the enemy and the stupidity of the those in power , brings disasters to both the country and the people , is totally void of conscience , contributes nothing to the contemporary time , leaves a legacy of trouble for a long time in future , and will definitely become a joke that those throughout all history will ridicule !
The other day , Xinwen Lianbo reported that the difficulty for enterprises to hire workers has extended to the west and swept the whole country !
The family planning policy is extremely stupid , brings disasters to both the country and the people , and is totally void of conscience !
Improving Population Quality Requires Transferring Reproduction Rights to the Rich ?
Through free exchanges on the market , nearly everything can be bought and sold .
Today , the right to bear a second child is also becoming a popular product with the rich .
They have money to buy the right , to bear the child , and to raise the child .
As to these transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child , let 's have a look at how the representatives argued and legally struggled with government officials at the " Two Meetings " .
Why did they propose such a transfer on the right to bear a second child ?
To this question , Li Xinghao - the author of this proposal , NPC representative and Chairman of Zhigao Group , said that such a transfer is beneficial to improving the quality of the population .
Transferred to which kind of person , exactly ?
This representative identified 3 groups : First , people with strong educational backgrounds ; second , the rich class ; third , civil servants .
Li Xinghao asserts that " In today 's society , people with strong educational backgrounds , the rich class , and civil servants have relatively high social status , relatively good economics means , and can ensure basic educational conditions and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in " .
Why is such transfer practical ?
Li Xinghao gave his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand .
He said , " For a transfer , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not .
He said that the original motive for this proposal was rooted in his discovery that some families legally allowed to bear a second child , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they were to do so ;
while some rich families had a strong desire to bear a second child but did not have the allowance to do so .
He thinks that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform . "
This transfer proposal by Representative Li is indeed very smart .
On the one hand , it helps the government to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth ;
on the other hand , it also solves the structural conflict of the reproduction right market - the poor have allowances but can not afford the birth and upbringing , while the rich want to bear children but do n't have the allowance .
Based on Representative Li 's proposal , the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bearing and raising more children , while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bearing and raising fewer children .
Through such transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child between the rich and the poor , the government can unnoticeably narrow the ever - increasing gap between the poor and the rich without spending a single cent .
How can the wealth gap be narrowed through such transfer ?
This Representative Li has envisioned a fast track for the get - rich - first people to guide and assist the get - rich - later people . That is , " the allowance transferee shall give the transferor ' an entire sequence ' of help and support . "
" According to Li Xinghao 's plan , through lottery - type drawing , the transfer platform establishes a one - on - one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor .
As part of the assistance , the couple applying for the allowance to be transferred in to them will buy the transferring couple all the basic insurances currently required by the government , including social insurance , medical insurance , and personal accident insurance , and will continue to provide them with a minimum living guarantee for the rest of their lives .
Meanwhile , the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transferring couple 's child until he or she graduates from university .
What 's more , if the transferring couple intend to register as permanent urban residents , the applicant couple shall buy them a 35m2 socially subsidized apartment in the city where the applicants dwell , but all of the transferring couple 's land use rights in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple . "
What do our family planning officials think of this proposal that the State " utilize the transferring of rights to bear a second - child to improve the population quality and make the get - rich - first help the get - rich - later so as to realize common prosperity " ?
In response , " Yesterday , Zhang Feng , Director of Guangdong Provincial Family Planning Commission , made his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce is absolutely not transferrable .
In the event that the right to reproduce is transferred , it would not only be a violation of law , but also bring moral questions if it involved a transaction . "
Through transferring their right to bear a second child and the concomitant obligations imposed on the transferees , the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get - rich - first class , if the proposal can pass and become law , the poor undoubtedly have found in the rich class , well - educated class , and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die . Marvelous indeed .
He claims it is not a transaction , but how can it be otherwise ? In this bundle of obligations for common prosperity , where is the dignity of the poor ?
Does not the bundle of obligations proposed by this Representative Li still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use rights ?
Certainly , without such exchange of interests , why would the rich take an interest in providing for the children of the poor ?
If the legislature really wants to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get - rich - first class leading the get - rich - later class to become rich by giving them one - on - one guidance and assistance so as to improve our population quality and narrow our wealth gap , it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interests and during the transfer .
Transferred together with a wet nurse .
Following it with interest .
For a transfer of the right to marry , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not . Since I discovered that some men who have a legal right to marry , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they did marry ;
while some rich men have a strong desire to marry N concubines ( because their mistresses often fuss about wanting to get married ) but they do not have the allowance , and would be guilty of bigamy .
I think that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry .
Pillaging the flesh till the bones are seen ?
Interesting ... interesting
Logic of hooligans .
Directly transfer the wife
A pack of luxury cigarettes ranges from as little as a few tens of yuan to more than a hundred yuan , if you smoke a stick , you are puffing away one month 's salary for an ordinary worker .
If it was bought with public funds , it may be said that what they are smoking are not cigarettes but the " blood and sweat " of the taxpayers .
NPC Representative Ma Wenfang proposed that consumption of tobacco products on public expenses should be universally banned .
There are of course many reasons as to why we lag far behind in meeting our tobacco control objectives .
But one of the undisputable reasons is that a huge smoker 's group exists within our huge contingent of civil servants .
Among this legion of smokers , a considerable number smoke " free cigarettes " which they do n't have to buy with their own money , as they were received as gifts or bought with public funds .
It is precisely because they are not using their own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarettes which are unaffordable for most people .
Their track performance for blowing smoke rings also has a compounding effect in repeatedly setting new records for consumption expenses by civil servants , and it has become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole .
It was precisely this horrifying social backdrop that prompted NPC Representative Ma Wenfang to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco products on public funds be universally banned .
In our country , there are many civil servants who think their family name is " Gong " and such that every expense incurred by them , regardless of whether it is for public or private purpose , should be borne by the public . Therefore , consumption on public expenses can involve almost everything imaginable .
For instance , besides luxury cigarettes , other examples include luxury liquor , fine wining and dining , luxury cars , and overseas tours , and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine , they would want to have them all and enjoy them to fullest , using public funds to settle the bill in full .
If the supreme authorities had to draw up separate regulatory documents to address every single item for consumption on public expenses for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagances , the mountain of documents will really extend towards the sky .
In fact , all that needs to be done is to clearly include tobacco products within the anti - corruption regulations ' relevant clauses for prohibition of consumption on public funds , and it will suffice .
As for the remaining issues , we must ensure that the orders and prohibitions are fully enforced . If any civil servant dares to violate the law , he will be severely punished according to the law and regulations .
If this was really carried out in all localities at every level , there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expenses , including smoking on public funds , can not be curbed .
After deputies and committee members have moved into their quarters in the hotel , how would service staff greet them ?
Some greet them with " Deputy So - and - so " or " Committee Member So - and - so ; " while some call NPC deputies " chief , " which makes some deputies , especially deputies from the grass - roots level , feel somewhat embarrassed . Some deputies even request service staff to " not call me chief . "
Calling deputies and committee members who have moved into their quarters in the hotel " chief " is , of course , out of the hotel service staff member 's formal respect , but it has actually caused misunderstanding of the identity of deputy or committee member .
As major national events , the convening of the two conferences has clearly provided the path ahead for our development .
However , at the two conferences , according to common sense , the identity of " deputy " or " committee member " is generally used , that is , " Deputy xx " or " Committee Member xx . " But I can not say much for the mention of " deputy as a chief . "
Through the subtlety of greeting , we can see common people 's sense of awe towards " deputies " and " committee members . "
Actually , when providing services to deputies and committee members , what 's wrong with being a bit simple ?
Would n't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as " Deputy xx " or " Committee Member xx ? "
After greeting them as chiefs , do n't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness ?
As deputies , they should equally treasure their own first identity . Deputy or committee member is neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title . This identity means enormous responsibility .
At the " times of the two conferences , " deputies and committee members should have an even heightened sense of responsibility . No matter what kind of social status you yourself have , remember firmly your own first identity and most important identity is a deputy , a committee member .
This is just a tidbit at the two conferences . The conferences that follow will unfold more exciting contents in front of us .
They are scumbags
Gosh , they even dare to use the word ' awe . ' Common people could n't wait to ' despise ' them , how could they have a sense of ' awe ? '
What would you say , which thingy there is publicly elected by common people formed by the first , second , and third person such as you , me , and him ?
Before the two national conferences were convened , various major news websites and periodicals across the country in succession invited netizens and readers nationwide to submit " suggestions for the two conferences . "
This writer from " suggestions for the two conferences " submitted by netizens across the country on various major news websites on the central government 's strengthening of efforts to oppose corruption and promote honest government , better supervision of the government and officials , and severe punishment for people engaged in embezzlement and corruption .
When CPPCC delegate Mao Xinyu checked in to attend the " two conferences " and spoke of a motion he proposed this year , he said the emphasis was on anti - corruption efforts .
The anti - corruption drive involves everyone , from the ordinary people below up to and including the delegates to the two conferences .
At present , public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide has already reached 300 billion a year .
Such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowds out expenditure on things vital for people 's welfare , including education , hygiene , healthcare , and social security .
Figures listed in a bill drawn up by the Jiusan Society 's central organization before the two conference in 2012
are really unbelievable : annual public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reaches 300 billion ! How large is this figure of 300 billion ?
If we saved this 300 billion and invested it in the economically undeveloped and impoverished regions in China , how many schools could we build ?
How many poor families could we assist ? How many children forced to leave school could we assist ?
It 's a pity that this 300 billion is squandered with no results , wasted in the pursuit of debauchery , by corrupt officials - How could our people not hate the " parasites " hidden among the membership ranks of the Communist Party ?
When corruption among government officials is brought up , the ordinary people all gnash their teeth , but the ordinary people are , after all , the ordinary people , and can only look on helplessly in silent fury .
The ordinary people can not afford to upset government officials , for if the ordinary people dared to upset government officials , they would be cracking eggs against rocks . Not only could they get more than they bargained for ; if something went wrong , they could end up in prison , or even endanger their lives .
Every year , there are cases across the country where ordinary people , because of reporting government officials , suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they are dealt with harshly .
It is common for ordinary people , with no other means of redress , to post on the Internet out of resentment against savage land requisitions or the savage demolition of homes and forced relocation by local government officials , but what fate do they often bring on themselves ?
Local government officials easily pin some labels on you , and you can even be chased and arrested by public security bodies across provincial boundaries .
The most terrible thing is not the government officials , but the power that lies in the hands of these officials .
How can we prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds ? "
If we are to prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds , " we must first " block " the officials ' mouths ,
but this is easier said than done . Why ?
As people working in a lower - level work unit , if leaders from higher - level work units come , do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice things to eat and drink ?
If they are not entertained well with nice things to eat and drink , after they 've gone , will officials in the lower - level work unit still have a future ?
To their subordinates , senior leaders are all their " masters . " You ca n't afford to upset any of them , and whoever upsets them is in for it . If you rub them up the wrong way when you 're trying to butter them up , you wo n't just jeopardize your official position , you wo n't even know what the consequences will be .
To stop the " three types of consumption on public funds , " senior officials must first " block " their own mouths .
In April 2011 , when the no. 6 inspection group of Hubei 's provincial party committee went to Yichang city on an inspection tour of Zigui county , a national - level impoverished county , the local government officials were both delighted and worried .
What delighted them was that they had an opportunity to report their problems to senior leaders and have them taken seriously by them , and what worried them was that there were 13 people in the inspection group , coming for 20 days or so , and the entertainment expenses , the cost of the gifts , and the inspection fees and various other items of expenditure would altogether come to 801,900 yuan .
How could this national - level impoverished county pay the bills ?
This example is the best illustration that if we are to prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds , " we must first stop the senior government officials .
If the upper beams are correctly placed , the lower beams will not go awry .
If the central state authorities are to stop the " three types of consumption on public funds , " they must dare to do what they mean .
It should be said that wining and dining on public funds as pointed out by scholars is an objective reality .
With the increasing prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass - roots institutions , alcohol has already been fermented and adulterated by the so - called " bureaucratic culture " beyond recognition .
Some people put on high - end wine banquets trying to please their superiors , some people use alcohol as gifts to seek personal gain , some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by using beer games , and some people get carried away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness , adversely affecting their work .
Every year the amounts of food trashed and money wasted as a result of wining and dining on public funds are even more appalling .
This writer has lived for a long time at the grass - roots level and often heard and witnessed some grass - roots officials almost sitting at meal gatherings or attending banquets every day , and never getting tired of it .
How much is the wining and dining expense at the grass - roots level in one year ? A specific number is virtually never published .
Actually , the insiders are well aware that this is a considerably high expenditure .
Who should be blamed for the grass - roots officials ' wining and dining becoming common practice ?
Speaking with regard to the grass - roots levels , it is indeed necessary to conduct rectification and to straighten things up according to the relevant regulations , but focusing on the grass - roots levels alone may not be enough .
Throughout the year , various types of inspection groups and investigation groups , as numerous as the hairs on an ox , come and go in an endless stream , also making the grass - roots institutions overburdened . Some grass - roots leading cadres , with no choice but to run between the various dinner parties every day , also feel somewhat helpless .
There are also many people wallowing in the array of wine glasses and poker chips becoming " vessels for wine and bags for food . "
This writer met with some township officials . Facing more and more dinner parties , many of them are fed up with it , but also feel forced and helpless .
The reasoning they explained is that entertaining is just for solving problems .
A township official , using his fingers to count , told this writer that in order to solve financial , road repair , canal construction projects and so on , they must entertain the relevant personnel and department heads , otherwise it will be of no avail .
When I look back to all these years , the urban construction in Beijing has experienced rapid development .
Some people said that it borrowed the easterly wind of the Olympics . However , I think otherwise .
Even though the 2008 Olympics allowed Beijing to display its charisma in front of cameras of all caliber that frocked in from all sides ,
it has almost been four years since the Olympics and the urban development in Beijing still has not stopped .
Speaking of urban development , the most representative one is none other than the Beijing subway .
Those who were born and raised in Beijing in the 80s can almost be called the generation who grew up sitting on the subway .
The public transportation then could not be considered as convenient compared to now . Buses could hardly be said as providing easy access to all directions .
However , with their extensive coverage , the two subway lines provided novelty and convenience to many Beijing residents and visitors who travelled from afar .
The subway is a distinguishing traffic feature of Beijing . As one of the first Chinese cities to have underground transportation , the emergence of subway has provided everyone more choices .
This underground railway line that runs through eastern and western Beijing has become Beijing 's symbol of alternative culture .
Day by day , Beijing is developing , so are its public transport and highways . Eventually , it will usher in the alarming data of 5 million cars in 2012 .
Meanwhile , the crowded highways and complicated road traffic cause people to have greater expectations in the development of the subway .
I have to applaud the continuous increase in the efforts in subway construction of Beijing in all these years when I talk about subway development .
In July 2001 , with the success in the bid to host the Olympics , Beijing subway Line 13 also ushered in the completion of the entire line and became the newest member of the Beijing subway family .
Meanwhile , in October 2007 , the closely watched subway Line 5 went into operation . It became the new trunk that links southern and northern Beijing and intersects with Line 1 .
While Beijing residents enjoyed the modernization of subway Line 5 , in July 2008 , the first phase of construction of subway Line 10 and in September 2009 , subway Line 4 and Line 8 all became operational one after another . At the same time , all suburban districts and counties are all connected by the subway successively .
In about 10 years time , the Beijing subway transformed from an underground supplementary means of transport that only had two lines to a 15 - lined underground transportation network that covers almost the entire Beijing from Changping in the north to Daxing in the south , Mentougou in the west , and Tongzhou District in the east .
Such rapid development was almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country .
While 2012 is quickly approaching , there is even the spectacular scene of four lines opening at the same time . It is veritably " putting all firepower into operation " !
The rapid coverage of underground transportation has brought along prosperity to surrounding communities of the subway . Residents no longer have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out .
More residents gladly choose to travel by subway . It is both convenient and cozy .
Needless to say , the subway has brought about convenience to the travel and work of the residents . More commendable is that the convenient subway has allowed more residents to give up their cars and choose such green means of transportation that is environmental friendly .
Not only does a reduction in cars on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road ; it also reduces the pressure of air pollution so that more residents can cheer for the blue sky of Beijing from their heart .
These are all contributions of the subway . Yet , where did the contributions of the subway come from ? They were naturally from the rapid development of the subway in Beijing within these 10 years .
The development of the subway is the same as the rapid global development of the city of Beijing , it will become a permanent city symbol of Beijing and a benefiting project that earns the satisfaction of the residents and the respect of the world .
Beijing Forces Ma Ying - jeou to Declare Stand on Unification , Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back
It can be said that the elections that cover five major cities have stirred up a storm in Taiwan .
In the midst of all this commotion , James Soong made a sudden appearance to come head to head with Ma Ying - jeou in the elections .
This made the already worried Ma Ying - jeou even more anxious , but there is nothing he can do .
This is linked to the earlier stand mainland China made regarding military cooperation with Taiwan . In addition , James Soong has expressed clearly that his taking part in the elections is to tell Ma Ying - jeou that he had worked hard to get the 1992 Consensus from mainland China and Ma should not let everyone down .
Regarding the chaos in Taiwan and the future ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan , what else do we still need to face ? What else do we have to do ?
Regarding the " weathervane " of Ma Ying - jeou 's stand , what other preparations should we make ?
James Soong 's transfer of allegiance is to force the undecided Ma Ying - jeou to declare his stand on the ultimate unification
Soong 's transfer of allegiance is , in a certain sense , a kind of response to mainland China 's intention .
On the issue of mainland China and Taiwan , Ma Ying - jeou has gotten a lot of room for maneuvering ,
from playing the Taiwan independence card for the sake of the elections to playing the card of attacking mainland China and achieving military balance for the sake of the elections . However , on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan , not only did Ma Ying - jeou fail to make any progress , he even took a big step backward .
In the past , he was standing close to the middle . Now , he is starting to gradually follow the footsteps of the DPP . He keeps pushing the bottom line of mainland China for the mere sake of manipulating the elections . Furthermore , he completely ignores the compromises made by mainland China and the effort it has put in for peaceful unification .
To save the Taiwanese economy , mainland China has made huge policy adjustments such as absorbing Taiwan 's excess industrial capacity , buying Taiwan 's excess agricultural products , giving several Taiwanese political figures room for international affairs to carry out international affairs , etc.
However , after all this waiting , in the end it has to face Ma Ying - jeou'a a double - headed snake that is seemingly false and real at the same time .
Therefore , facing this undecided Ma Ying - jeou , James Soong stepped up to defend mainland China !
Is n't Ma Ying - jeou wanting to score more points for his selection ? Is n't he wanting to elevate his position through manipulating the people ?
The moment James Soong appeared , the situation changed ! This is to force Ma Ying - jeou to stop manipulating the elections and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan !
Ma Ying - jeou is Not Mainland China 's Only Choice , But Mainland China is Going to Be Ma Ying - jeou 's Only Choice
So , what cards is Old Ma left with to play ?
Military purchase - fetus died in the womb ;
economic development - eclipsed by the prosperity of mainland China ;
culture - fully integrated with mainland China as well ;
as for military affairs - Taiwanese soldiers , whether ex - service or in service , are all under the control of mainland China 's military departments .
As for the key Taiwanese figures who hold military power , mainland China has long ago convinced them with reasons .
Fellow countrymen should not slaughter one another , and brothers should not turn against one another - this makes the Taiwanese military less hostile towards mainland China .
As for the withdrawal of missiles proposed by Ma Ying - jeou , it is also no longer an issue now .
So what is Ma Ying - jeou still waiting for ? For a major change to take place in Taiwan ?
To mainland China , Ma Ying - jeou is no longer mainland China 's only choice .
Mainland China is actively seeking all forces in Taiwan that can be sought . Even the DPP is starting to change its course .
However , Ma Ying - jeou , who is holding on and keeping his mouth tight , has no other choices except mainland China , in other words , mainland China is Ma Ying - jeou 's only choice .
Basically , all the big bosses of the Kuomintang have visited mainland China and even received VIP treatment , getting all the respect they deserved .
So , is Ma Ying - jeou thinking about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?
Ma Ying - jeou might offend some people in Taiwan who are eager to achieve Taiwan independence , but Ma Ying - jeou can gain the respect of the entire Chinese population of 1.4 billion . Comparing the two , it should be clear which is important and which is not .
When Nixon visited China back then , he turned the Sino - American relationship around . So , does n't Ma Ying - jeou want his name to go down in history ?
Could it be that being the bill of a chicken is really better than being the anus of an ox ?
Hence , Ma Ying - jeou should understand that he is only one of the choices of mainland China . It is up to him whether he wants to achieve success and acquire fame .
Watch out for Ma Ying - jeou 's Continued Military Resistance against Unification by the Lease - to - own method
Though the United States has recently increased its military presence in the Asia Pacific region , it is showing a rare undecided stand on the Taiwan issue .
The United States is no longer able to tell where Taiwan is heading , because all Taiwanese senior politicians are talking about unification and there is less and less talk about secession .
Furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland China and Taiwan regarding the Diaoyu Islands has made the United States feel somewhat unable to do what it wants to do .
However , some people from the United States and Taiwan are still somewhat intelligent .
They no longer talk about military purchase but started proposing a lease - to - own method for Taiwan to get weapons .
The weapons Taiwan has now are old .
The lease - to - own method might bring some advantages in conducting cutting - edge military confrontation with mainland China , but fundamentally speaking , Taiwan no longer has the strength to fight against mainland China .
If it continues to take its old path of resisting unification through military forces , then it will meet a very tragic ending !
Diaoyu Islands Will be a Touchstone - Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back
Of course , there are still many opportunities for mainland China and Taiwan . For example , the Diaoyu Islands is the first touchstone of cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan .
When it comes to the Diaoyu Islands , mainland China and Taiwan can jointly deploy naval vessels , jointly defend the Diaoyu Islands , and join hands in fighting Japan .
Recently , within Taiwan , active actions have been taken concerning the ownership of Taiwan as well .
For example , there have been active changes as to how the Japan issue is treated , how the historical issue of the resistance war is treated , and how the issue of Taiwan as part of mainland China in the past is treated .
It is these changes that made the entire Taiwan , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by staying close to mainland China .
Facing mainland China 's offensive efforts towards unification , Taiwan can no longer turn back .
Taiwan will become another traitor if it goes into Japan 's embrace . Only by going into mainland China 's embrace will Taiwan have a bright future !
In short , James Soong is merely someone through whom mainland China 's stance ranging from active cooperation to slight warning is demonstrated .
If Ma Ying - jeou does not want to oversleep after going back to bed in the morning , he must truly face what the people of both sides of the Strait have been hoping for for a century !
It is up to him whether he wants to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !
When that time comes , the people of mainland China will respond enthusiastically to Ma Ying - jeou !
What 's going on !
Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ?
Endangering the society !
Really , one should not be a Samaritan
If you help the other person get up but she does not appreciate it and even pushes you , then you should not help her anymore .
Yet you help her again ...
Do n't tell jokes at the seaside . It will trigger tsunami
It is really too tragic
Meeting violence with violence does not benefit anyone
Woes of the society .
Those who make trouble after getting drunk should be punished without leniency . Detestable
The following is a quote from Qiuyeyuanmaoerkong from the second posting :

If severe punishment is not given , in future everyone will pretend to be drunk and make trouble

A Letter from the Victim 's Family
First of all , I would like to thank a kind - hearted person for calling the police immediately . I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .
Early in the morning on September 1 , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise . At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beaing him ( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) . As a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived . As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life - saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots . Due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .
Right now , my father is in very serious condition . On September 1 , he underwent a 5 - hour craniotomy . On September 2 , he had a tracheotomy and a respirator was used to help him breathe . Currently , he is still unconscious . After these few days of hospital treatment , he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet , and he is showing signs of recovery .
As his children , we feel very terrible now . It has been six days since the incident . Under the police 's advice , the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan . We have already delivered the money to the hospital . Now , almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills . We do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills .
We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital . If we do not pay on time , the hospital will stop supplying medications . When that happens , I can not bear to think of what will happen to my father .
Our family has very poor living conditions . My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan , and she has diabetes . My father is a retired coking plant worker . His pay is also just a bit over 1,000 yuan . I am doing odd jobs at a factory , and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions . My elder sister is also an odd - job worker . She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions . Furthermore , I am going to be a father soon . I have a very heavy family burden . Our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . We absolutely can not afford such high hospital costs .
It has been six days since the incident . As victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things :
1. Where are the perpetrators from ? How are their family and financial conditions ?
2. When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate ? When can public prosecution be initiated ?
3. We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .
4. We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind - hearted father .
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .
After the court verdict is out , all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau .
A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident . May all you kind - hearted people have a life of peace !
Victim 's son
Why helped him up when he was sleeping happily ?
Faint . The social morality system is about to collapse . Everything must be torn down and start all over again . Sigh
Manhunt . Post the pictures of that bunch of perpetrators !
Tragedy
What a turbulent society
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually
Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually . Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
Sentence all of them to life imprisonment and let 's see if they are going to pay
Poor old man . He 's still stuck in the era of learning from Lei Feng . The society today is a mess .
It 's tough to be a good person !
It 's tough to be a good person !
Punish severely ! It looks like we have to mind our own business !
It is legal as long as three hours of sunshine can be achieved .
Most high - rise buildings with a spacing of 100 meters can certainly achieve that .
Three hours of sunshine , from morning till night , can certainly be achieved .
Most sunlight issues raised by the elderly men and women are indeed not against the national requirements , so they 're merely unreasonable complaints of the elderly as a result of their perceived discomfort .
Even if there is a court judgment confirming that the developer is not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demands .
Reply to Light - and - shadow - hero on the 10th floor :
Three hours of sunshine is a technical term . Sunlight analysis is needed . Setbacks of spacing are related to not only the sunshine spacing but also the floor thickness . A sunshine spacing coefficient of 1:1.4 can meet the requirement for three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold in Taizhou . All we want is that the developer does the job legally , and makes it clear that sunshine analysis has shown that the minimum national requirements can be met !
But what you said is also somewhat reasonable . The minimum standards are not acceptable to most people . They have a good reason to ask for more sunlight . However , this developer is too strong . We just want to secure the minimum legitimate interests according to the national regulations , but even that is so difficult for us !
Guanxi and operations , alas .
I remain poised
China : There are too many issues now ! Is that because good officials are too few ?
Developers always want to make more money . We have a building here , which has not been pulled down so far even after exposed by CCTV . How powerful the developers are .
The following is a quotation of All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 's words on the 1st floor :
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! ...
Uh ... Do you have legislative power or enforcement power ?
In Zhenjiang , Jiangsu , an old man doing morning exercise helped a drunk man up and was mistaken as a thief and badly beaten up
Five young men who work as chefs at Zhenjiang Hotel were strolling on the street in the early morning on the 2nd after downing several bottles of beer .
One of the men , Ji , squatted on the stone step of a bus stop .
Mr. Yang , an old man from Zhenjiang who is in his 60s , was passing by while on his morning exercise . After seeing that , he asked Ji to go home soon , and then held out his hands to help Ji up .
However , Ji mistook Mr. Yang for wanting to steal his things , so immediately together with Wu and Ma , he battered the old man violently till he was seriously injured !
Murderers all go for the head !
I think they meant to kill him !
Latest news : Victim Mr. Yang passed away around 9 a.m. on 9/13/2011 . Perpetrators remain under criminal detention .
However , this incident has not yet come to a close . The victim 's family may still have to wait for the police to conduct an autopsy on the victim .
Regarding this incident , both sides involved have posted relevant comments in this thread . They are in postings no. 74 and no. 77 .
A Letter from the Victim 's Family
First of all , I would like to thank a kind - hearted person for calling the police immediately . I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .
Early in the morning on September 1 , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise .
At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon .
Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beating him
( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) ,
as a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated .
However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived .
As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life - saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots .
Due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .
Right now , my father is in very serious condition .
On September 1 , he underwent a 5 - hour craniotomy . On September 2 , he had a tracheotomy , and a respirator was used to help him breathe .
Currently , he is still unconscious .
After these few days of hospital treatment , he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet , and he is showing signs of recovery .
As his children , we feel very terrible now .
It has been six days since the incident . Under the police 's advice , the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan . We have already delivered the money to the hospital .
Now , almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills . We do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills .
We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital .
If we do not pay on time , the hospital will stop supplying medications . When that happens , I can not bear to think of what will happen to my father .
Our family has very poor living conditions . My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan , and she has diabetes .
My father is a retired coking plant worker . His pay is also only a bit over 1,000 yuan .
I am doing odd jobs at a factory , and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions .
My elder sister is also an odd - job worker . She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions .
Furthermore , I am going to be a father soon . I have a very heavy family burden .
Our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . We absolutely can not afford such high hospital costs .
It has been six days since the incident . As victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things :
1. Where are the perpetrators from ? How are their family and financial conditions ?
2. When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate ? When can public prosecution be initiated ?
3. We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .
4. We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind - hearted father .
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .
After the court verdict is out , all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau .
A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident .
May all you kind - hearted people have a life of peace !
Victim 's son
Latest development
Victim : Old Mr. Yang is currently still unconscious and in critical condition .
The family members of Old Mr. Yang said tearfully that when the old man was being sent to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . He has been transferred to ICU ( intensive care unit ) after receiving emergency treatment given by the hospital .
The medical costs alone add up to as much as more than 5,000 yuan a day .
Perpetrators : Three men have been criminally detained by Zhenjiang Jingkou police .
After the three of them paid 10,000 yuan in total for the medical costs ,
the family of Ma recently again raised 10,000 yuan to pay for surgery .
Hereby , we hope the perpetrators will be able to show resolution in taking on responsibilities and face seriously the mistake that has been committed .
Victim 's family : As Old Mr. Yang is still in a toxic and unconscious state , he is unable to provide information about what happened at the time of the incident .
Though the three perpetrators have paid 10,000 yuan compensation in total , it is obviously not enough to pay for the current medical costs that are increasing sharply by the day .
Furthermore , in view of the criminal detention time limit , can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrators ?
How about future medical costs ?
The Yang family hopes to get legal and media assistance .
Associated incidents
The moment this incident came out , this writer could not help but recall the " touch porcelain " case that happened two years ago !
Cases like the one where " a vehicle owner who helped an old lady lying on the ground get up was accused of knocking her down " all raised a huge uproar across town .
Sometimes , I even doubt the frequency at which such incidents happen , life is getting to really look like fiction !
The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse .
Let 's not say much . Let 's pray for the injured and hope the perpetrators get punished .
The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ?
Who dares to be a Samaritan in future ?
The important thing is to save life !
Are there any solutions ? Provide legal assistance !
Let the law show its might ~
It takes 30 days before public prosecution is initiated . Even day lilies wither by then ! ~
This is actually not about being a Samaritan or not . Many drunkards have lost their consciousness and will get in a drunken fit .
When you want to help , you have to see who it is . If you ca n't handle , just call 120. Sigh ...
Severe punishment still should be given to those who commit crimes after drinking . If not , it will be chaos if everyone pretends to be drunk and bashes up others .
Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
Such a cup .
The old man was looking for trouble . He should have kept a distance after seeing those drunkards .
Would everyone agree with illegal construction of high - rise buildings ?
Now , in the hometown of our beloved General Secretary Hu , such a strange thing is happening .
Here is the thing : Shenzhen Maoye Developer has come to Hailing District , Taizhou City , Jiangsu Province for urban construction , and is welcomed by our people .
We do not oppose the construction of high - rise buildings . However , the developer is going to construct a high - rise building against the law . That is what we are resolutely opposed to !
Maoye Developer has planned a high - rise building of 150 m in the Julangchao lot of the old East Station , Hailing District , Taizhou City .
Julangchao used to be the eastern suburbs park , for which many of the old Taizhou people have great affection .
Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is just located at the back of the Julangchao lot , and now Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is only about 100 meters from the external walls of the original buildings at the farthest end of the Julangchao lot .
How does the developer meet the national requirement for building setbacks based on a minimum sunshine spacing of 1:1.4 in Taizhou ?
Aside from the other sunshine shelters , how can the developer ensure a minimum three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold ?
It is certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the 3 hours technically ,
The plain fact is just in front of us . Moreover , are those few entities the only ones capable of doing sunshine analysis in China ?
We certainly will verify it . A lie will never become the truth !
If the developer can not even give us owners a minimum of three hours on the day of Great Cold in accordance with the national requirement , which has ensured its best interests , how can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society , the vast community of netizens and the masses ?
Where are the conscience and morals of the developer ?
We understand that the developer wants to get more benefits , but those are supposed to be legitimate benefits !
On the one hand , such act , if illegally infringing upon other people 's interests , will be detrimental to the reputation and long - term future development of the entire Maoye group . On the other hand , are people whose interests are infringed all fools ?
Will they just let the infringement occur ?
The minimum 3 hours is already difficult to accept . If it is basically an illegal act that makes the fundamental three hours even less , think about it - how will things evolve ?
Finally , the contradictions are bound to intensify , making the situation out of hand .
We hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue , avoid losses and seek its own legal interests through rational development and reasonable development according to law !
If the developer are determined to infringe on our rights and interests , we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate rights and interests !
The most strange thing is that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high - rise buildings . We hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high - rise buildings to raise their hands and give us a way out !
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer !
All netizens are welcome to look into this matter !
Hello , everyone !
Previously , due to issues about the high - rise buildings on Maoye 's pre - sale renderings and EIA by the Taizhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau , the young and old of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 were neither sleeping nor eating well . Some were depressed , and some were irritated . In short , we felt very angry .
Now Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau has given us a clear answer that those were simply renderings . Upon verification , the Planning Bureau has requested the developer to make modification . The Bureau will definitely exercise administration according to law , and never approve anything unless it is legal , reasonable and fair ! A forum and a hearing will also be held prior to approval ! A large stone in our hearts has finally dropped onto the ground .
We are moved that in the face of such a huge benefit , our leaders of Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau have stood unswayed , showing a very noble sentiment and reflecting the characteristics of the Communists in serving the people , which is truly admirable !
All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau for upholding justice ! People living in Taizhou are happy , thanks to the officials caring for them like their parents !
We thank the government for its concerns over people ! We strongly support for the government administration according to law !
All owners , Pengxinlidu Building No. 14

I hope that the developer does not come to compete against us for sunlight . How do we live without sunlight ?
All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! For us ordinary people who are like dog shit in this society , it is ridiculous to discuss whether power or law is superior .
I feel really good about that oh oh
What 's the point of law over power ?
It is the powerful that make the final execution .
Yeah , in the real world , we vulnerable groups really feel at a loss as to what to do so often . The power of developers is too great ,
Some relevant government departments just blatantly give the green light to developers against the law and help them fool people !
So we have to frequently ask ourselves : is the law enacted by this country really useful ?
Is it really capable of restraining developers from grabbing through deceit or by force and illegally obtaining benefits ?
But we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight , leaving children and the elderly shivering at home in cold winter . If so , we ca n't live a healthy life , nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun !
Japan had been thinking about invading China for a long time . Would it need the assignment from Russia to decide whether to invade China or not ? Not to mention that the US only acts against the political system of China ? Was it still not enough for Russia to be fooled after 1991 ?
The weapons market in South Asia has been dominated by the hairy country . Though it is weakened by the US weapons market , however , the Russian weapons market still occupies the major portion .
It is not Russia deliberately making use of countries on the South China Sea to besiege China .
Looking at the chaos in the East China Sea and the South China Sea , even thinking with your ass , you will also know that it is the US rather than Russia trying to cause trouble .
Firstly , Russia is not a country with sea power . It has no interest in intervening and meddling in the issues of the East and South China Seas .
Secondly , at present , with the expansion and extrusion of NATO , Russia can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence . We can say it is busy enough with its own affairs .
And presently , the Asia - Pacific Military Cooperation and NATO are all products of the US 's two - ocean strategy .
After World War I , two systems had taken place . One is the Versailles System in Europe and the Atlantic , and the other was the US - Japanese Washington System in the Far East and the Pacific .
The US stretches over the two oceans , and controls the two systems at the same time .
After World War II , it took control of the two systems respectively , castrating Germany in Europe , and Japan staying alone in Asia to be hermaphrodites , living on by helping the US manufacture electronics and automobile products .
And now , the biggest enemies for the US are such large geopolitical powers in the Old World as Russia and China .
While Russia and the West have no so - called estrangement in ideology and political system , NATO still continues to expand to the east .
And now the Asia - Pacific Military Cooperation is setting up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal regions in East and South China .
The coup in Central Asia has not succeeded . Otherwise , once the ring of encirclement is completed , the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the East China Sea and the South China Sea .
Do you still believe that China can become a friend of the US as long as it changes its ideology and system ?
The reasons for China to ally with Russia are that both Russia and China need to heal their wounds from after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and with the savage hegemony of the US .
Solving the existing territorial disputes is an important means of realizing mutual trust . Of course China has made great concessions . There is no other choice .
In fact , unlike China , Russia has neither the policy of reform of opening up nor a good future ( this precious opportunity was seized by China at the historical turning point then , while in Russia , it was ruined by the two idiots at the critical moment . It also shows that the Russians are relatively inferior to the Chinese people in terms of both IQ and EQ ) .
The Russians are bare - footed , so they are not afraid of a China with shoes .
China has enough reasons to make concessions to Russia . China has no fear . China has many opportunities and China has other approaches .
Although Russia is not our friend , we should not turn it into an enemy .
Russia and Japan should not be equated with each other .
To the Chinese people , if Russia wantonly killed Chinese people in China 's traditional area of activities like Japan did , then in the sentiments of ordinary Chinese people , they would hate Russia as much as they hate Japan . However , they did not .
The only case where they wantonly killed Chinese people happened at the end of the Tsing Dynasty . It was the disputable Hailanpao Slaughter .
Thousands or tens of thousands , the number is just a small proportion even compared with the population of the Manchu .
It can even be ignored if compared with the Chinese population of nearly 400 million . Can it be equated with Japan 's massacre of Chinese people in the populated North and Southeast of China ?
Besides , Russia is a European country with its strategic focus in the west . The Far East is never its focus .
If the Russians really want to seriously take China as their arch enemy , they should strive to construct the Far East .
However , nowadays , with its own serious problems , it continues to abandon the Far East and many cities have become heaps of ruins .
It shows that Russia 's strategic focus has been in the west , addressing the expansion of NATO . Only traitors will be advocating hostile relations between China and Russia here .
The US can pose a greater threat and impact upon China than Russia , especially in the core area of China .
The reasons are simple . Russia is a European country . The Far East is not its focus , while the US is a country in the Asia - Pacific region .
Do you know the theory of sea control ? Nowadays , is there more influence from the US or Russia in the issues of the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea and the Far East ? It is the US ! This is clear proof !
Do you think that territorial waters are n't territory ? In modern times , the strategic and economic values of territorial waters are much more than those of land territories . One can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by controlling the sea .
Why was it not China , its neighbor , but instead Great Britain , separated by vast oceans , that made India into a colony ?
Nowadays , Russia has serious problems itself . Its armaments are quite obsolete , and the living conditions for its people are extremely adverse . The population has faced a sharp reduction .
The national elites all know the home country is hopeless , so they all run abroad .
It has become common practice for women to marry foreigners , and many of them come to China and become prostitutes .
Even the productivity of the population is seriously lacking . It is impossible for it to constitute a threat to China .
And nowadays the US is besieging and containing China openly with a view of disrupting China .
Why leave the current problems unsolved , but seize on Russia , which has no ability to pose a threat to China at present ?
When it comes to that Russia occupied China 's territory , that is another story like the Japanese did . Japan wanted to invade the whole country of China , but can Russia do that ?
Russia is a European country with its strategic focus on the west , rather than the Far East . Its expansion to the Far East in history was also partly non - governmental and partly governmental .
Japan is separated from China only by a strait , with the spacious Pacific behind it . There is no menace from the rear if it invades China with all its strength . Can Russia do that ?
Even if Russia puts a little bit more energy into the issues of China and the Far East , can it ignore the affairs in Europe ?
Moreover , we would rather say that Russia has availed itself of opportunities , than to say that it had invaded and occupied China 's territories .
At that time , those places were far away from China 's traditional living area . China 's exploration was a little bit later at that time . There have been few inhabitants around those places in history .
At that time , those places were bitterly cold places covered with waist - deep snows . So we pay no heed to them .
Although when it comes to now , these places are of great economic and strategic importance . However , at that time we did n't discover that ; therefore , at that time even the ruler of China paid no heed to the places , and sent no immigrants there for quite a long time .
Just like today 's oceans . From the perspective of today , they have huge economic values , so territorial waters are also important territories .
However , in the past , they were not discovered . And territorial waters were not regarded as territories . They even exercised trade prohibition on the sea area and closed the coastlines .
Yet the Russians availed themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those places ahead of us . The Russians were just availing themselves of opportunities .
At that time , it was a time when big powers established colonies everywhere . Unlike today , when the behavior of all countries are bound by international laws .
Other big powers had to capture colonies by war . For example , it was through war that Britain and Japan occupied Hong Kong and Taiwan respectively .
However , the Russians got such a big place without much effort . That was because the ruler of China did n't care for the unexplored places .
They just availed themselves of opportunities . Things such as territory are hard to talk about .
If it was your imminent area of activity , it might be justifiable .
However , if it was a place that you did n't send immigrants to explore for a long period throughout history , and was taken by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access , then as time goes by it would be hard to say , after a certain length of time .
It would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours . This is totally different from Japan . Can Russia launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy China 's imminent territories like Japan did ?
Can it provoke * to invade northeast China and launch an all - out war of aggression against China because northeast China had become an imminent territory of China like northern China with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrants from inside Shanhaiguan Pass ? It is impossible .
The opinions of the writer Wuhan Tuo La Ji Shou on the upper floor are brilliant ! However , by reversing the order of " subjugation of the nation " and " elimination of the entire race , " would it be in line with the historical facts ?
Right now Russia is clamoring " to build India into the top military power in Asia . " Putin personally sealed the arms sale deal to sell India advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers , nuclear - powered submarines , T 50 fighters and BrahMos missiles ... Even the weapons it sells to Vietnam are more advanced than those it sells to China . And it only sells China big airplanes and carrier aircraft . Its wild ambitions are thoroughly exposed !
It is a pity that the present dynasty are national scum supported by the Soviet Union ! While the yellow Russians are prevailing , what else can the grass - root folks do ?
It seems that all Chinese hate Japanese , and I am not an exception . However , has everybody thought it over that it was Russia who stirred up the war between China and Japan for fear that China would reclaim territories from it ? It was also Russia that went between the Communist Party and the KMT and was able to achieve success one way or the other . And at the end of the war of resistance , it then stirred up the civil war , and lured China to get involved in the Korean War . If Stalin was still alive , China would have more trouble !
Even if it has propped up an agent in China , it is still concerned about China . And in the 21st century , it continues to play little tricks of provoking anti - Chinese sentiments . It sold weapons to Vietnam and checked and seized the cargos of Chinese merchants . Its crimes are so numerous that bamboo strips would be exhausted before they could all be recorded .
What is regretful is that our government deals with such kind of things in different ways . If the US or Japan does so , Mr. Qin Gang and Ms. Jiangyu would absolutely deliver a so - called just and severe statement of condemnation . Yet with regard to the incident of the Chinese boatmen who were shot by Russia , there was not even a protest presented . And it became an incident with no definite results in the year 2009 .
The greatest threat of subjugation of the nation comes from Russia . In history , countries being eliminated by this nation were as many as the stars in the sky . Moreover , in the history of China , almost all geographical threats came from the north .
The greatest threat of " elimination of the entire race " comes from Japan . The seed of national hatred is indelible . Once discharged accidentally , it would not be just territorial conflicts , but a massacre .
The greatest threat of downfall of D comes from the US . The dramatic contrast of ideology causes the US to treat all dictating Ds in the world as targets to be removed .
However , there is no need to worry that he would have any claims for territory .
The greatest threat to the economy comes from the EU . The EU frequently takes the opportunity of trade or human right conflicts between China and the US to grab a large portion of the market , and squeezes the surplus values . Now it has become our biggest trading partner .
Personally I think the geopolitical environment of China is quite adverse . However , Just as what the floor host said , the real threat comes from Russia .

Do you think nowadays that Russia still has the capacity to do that ?
If the Communist Party of China does not put the practical interests of the people first , but continues to tolerate the corrupt governments , the people would lose their faith in the Party , and in the near future it could hardly be avoided that the territories of China would be divided by an alliance of the US and Russia !
It was foreseeable that they have put their hands into our neighboring countries , and they have instigated pressures on our country from all sides . Has n't the government in power run by the Communist Party been claiming to be strong ? And now it is time for you to bring your wisdom into play ~
The Sino - Japanese war and the civil war of China were stirred up by Russia , and Russia has the ability to force China to send troops to North Korea ? Nonsense !
For China , China and United States have the biggest relationship in the world , and the Sino - US relationship is a trade - off relationship .
In the most recent visit to the US by Xi Jinping , which is an exercise before he becomes the top official in China , the primary topic discussed was mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two sides .
The Sino - US relationship is very complicated . Economically , the two sides are partners on unequal footings ,
politically , it is a relationship between socialism and capitalism ; militarily , Chinese and US militaries are in an isolated state .
Therefore , currently China is playing games with the United States , i.e. how to offset the latter two relationships with economic cooperation .
Next is a brief analysis of the main strategy of Xi Jinping 's visit to the US :
First , what is the biggest puzzle between China and the US ?
The biggest puzzle in front of China is how to maintain its relationship with the US as it becomes increasingly powerful .
To China , it can not fall out with the US .
If China falls out with the US , then it will seriously consumes China 's strengths and will be very unfavorable for future development of China ,
because China will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally , such that China has to cope with not only the powerful military threat posed by the US , but also complicated relations in the neighboring areas . This will seriously consume China energy for development .
Therefore , on the premise of not falling out with the US , China , on the one hand , still has to maintain relationship with the US , while on the other hand , it has to precaution against the dirty tricks that the US plays on China .
Second , it is not time yet to be tough to the US .
Some believe that China should be tough to the US . Is the US someone that yields to hawkishness ?
In the Soviet Union era , it got in a race for hegemony against the US , where both sides were so tough that they became enemies , which provided the US the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the Soviet Union .
As the US does not need the USSR to exist as a great power , the US could attack the USSR and tackle the USSR without any hesitation .
The road China is going along at present is one where the two sides are intertwined with each other , such that the US also suffers great loss when attacking and imposing sanctions on China .
What 's more , many businesspeople in the US also come out to oppose the government 's behaviors . China will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for ten years .
As the ancient saying goes , a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as ten years to avenge . If China falls out with the US too early , it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position .
Although we are strong today , it 's not time yet to fight the final battle with the US .
Third , the two phases that the Sino - US relationship will go through .
It is not advisable to fight a major war in the China 's dealings with the US .
The author believes the two sides could only undergo two phases . The first one is a period which sees China grow in strength and the US feel seriously threatened .
The second stage is when China has become strong , the US is no longer certain about winning a war with China , such that it has no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefits .
To avoid war between China and the US , it appears extremely important to carry out exchanges between the two peoples .
Next let 's have a look at survey results of Americans view towards China :
An opinion poll of a US website shows that 6 % of the people believe China and the US are " allies , " 69 % think they are " friendly but not allies , " and 4 % believe they are " enemies . "
Survey results also show that 71 % of the Americans believe Sino - US relations are " very important or somewhat important , " while the proportion is 85 % in opinion leaders .
On the 14th , the Washington Post said that in an opinion poll it conducted jointly with the American Broadcasting Company , 52 % of the respondents saw China in a negative way .
This result reflects two urgent issues . First , China is not that bad in the mind of American people , and there is still environment and scope to continue expanding exchanges .
Second , if China and the US do not handle their relations properly , lacking in communications between its peoples and the foundation or friendship , then the Chinese and American peoples may turn hostile .
Therefore , the Chinese and American peoples must enhance cooperation and bring the two sides closer through economic cooperation , so as to offset the discrepancies brought by military and politics .
However , it is undeniable that serious conflicts remain between China and the US in some important areas .
For instance : the Taiwan issue ; human rights and democracy ; North Korea ; Iran ; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; Pakistan ; geopolitics and military strategy ; trade and currency ; intellectual property rights and internet spies .
These puzzles can not be overcome with the two characters of friendship alone . After all it involves major interests .
So it is no secret to the two sides . Just like Vice President Xi Jinping counts on the US to oppose Taiwan independence and Tibetan , how could China count on a geopolitical enemy ?
National presidents are all masters in politics , who know what 's at stake . However , what should be said should be said . The thing is if the US has said something , it will break its words if it does n't do what it said , which will show to people in the world that the US is immoral and its words do n't count .
Anyway , between China and the US in the future , whoever is a better strategist and whoever comes up with more sophisticated strategy wins .
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
This view tells us a fact that one will earn respect by developing military force
The cannons are thicker
It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
Chairman Mao has said a long time ago : one will be beaten if he / she is backward . Only development is of overriding importance !
It is fun ? They are ordering the dog they feed at home to bark at you , yet you have gone to shake hands with them , looking for slaps
It is fun ? They are ordering the dog they feed at home to bark at you , yet you have gone to shake hands with them , looking for slaps
Brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .
Is it the American system that 's superior or the Chinese system that 's superior after all ?
I think Taiwan and the mainland are already distinguishing relative superiority or inferiority between them . The thread starter should take a look outside the country more
You look but not see the ZG 's chaos in society , or is it voluntary blindness !
I also feel that there are more modern " traitors of China " than during WWII .
Everyone has eyes , look at the living situations of North Korea and South Korea - do you still not understand ?
Venture exchange ,
If I take care of myself , that 's good enough , when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
If these traitors of China existed around 50 , 60 years ago , they would already have been executed by firing squad .
To make a conclusion , you must have something to demonstrate it
I do n't have time to go searching
I wish LZ would explain them one by one ...
Their property and families are all outside of the country , of course they will , just like the officials .
when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
I can just take a look , and dare not to speak my mind , the police can grab people , thread starter , I admire you for daring to speak ! Bump !
The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of China !
Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself .
Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China , let the Chinese themselves topple China -
and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so - called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and can not let outsiders use us .
He ca n't seem to help himself from apologizing for anything and everything .
Hallmark could make a fortune off of this guy .
I do n't follow , why should he apologize to Palin ?
Did Palin apologize to Giffords ?
He needs to conduct a beer summit between Palin and NBC .
Mend some fences and get this country moving .
He could call it the APOLOGIES ON BEER tour .
Hell , sell tickets and hire the Chinese to cater the event .
Who Drops Out After Super Tuesday ?
I think Romney wins big today and obviously stays in .
Santorum gets enough of a boost to do the Huckabee hangs around .
I think Gingrich 's sole win in GA is enough to hang it up and go back to making millions in the private sector .
I think the Good Doctor is too crazy to hang it up .
I will stick around until the end .
No one
I think Mitt drops out ...
Ok , my answer is no one and Obama wins the GE .
The only one with any reason to will be Newt , but I do n't think that he will .
Ron Paul says tornado victims should not get aid
Nuts .
My heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and I have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives .
If you have no problem with your tax dollars going to aid them then you 'd have no problem donating to them of your own free will .
Not to mention that he 's absolutely right that they should have insurance to cover them .
Ron Paul is not quite bright .
He 's right in some ways but it does n't translate into being right across the board .
This is n't like someone 's house burning down and they make an insurance claim .
Everything is gone , the entire infrastructure is gone .
Even if someone has insurance to cover their loss , that wo n't extend to the roads , power lines , sewers , public buildings .
The problem with this regime is aid is not distributed equally .
Democrats get it , minorities get it , white republican jurisdictions do n't .
Aid is now patronage , good party members get it .
Is n't it interesting how Libertarians ' desire for " freedom " correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give ANYONE , ANYTHING .
So while libertarianism attracts people who want to be " free " it also attracts cheap assholes who do n't want to pay their fair share .
Perhaps when Libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the two , I 'll vote for them .
I get what Ron Paul is saying .
Thats what a Hardcore Libertarian would say .
But the rest of us are thinking about the people that do not have insurance and / or need help right now .
Kind of hard to build a house over night , Mr Paul .
Kind of hard to import food considering that the stores are probably wiped out too .
How does one survive until the insurance ( hopefully by a respectable company ) claim comes through ?
How does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address ?
I know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town -- if you can find your damn pickup !!
Homeowners generally have insurance , but Federal Aid is necessary to provide for the clean up , repairs of electrical and water systems , roads , schools , buses , etc. etc.
Keep in mind insurance companies are not in the business of paying claims , they are in the business of making money .
Anyone who suffers a loss as have those who lost everything over the weekend will not be made whole , and whatever claim they receive will not come soon or easy .
Ron Paul and his Libertarian ideas are at best impractical .
No surprise there .
He had to win there to stay in , so ultimately this helps Mitt keep the vote split .
Best outcome of the night would have been Newt losing there .
He 's a nonfactor at this point and only in out of spite .
If he were out of the race , Santorum might have had a chance .
The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons .
Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities ?
Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent ?
Where is the morality when disease is spread ?
Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence ?
When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?
I am with you .
If you cant feed , house and take care of a baby you have no business having one .
Why is it literally 100 % impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you do n't want government involved in something does n't mean you 're against it ?
I 'm in favor of feeding , clothing , and giving shelter to the poor . I 'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things .
Now am I just a genius who does n't know it , or is it really not THAT hard to understand such a simple concept ?
Will they try to prop Romney up with a strong VP to help make him more palatable - or will they bring in a new face ?
Either way , they 've got a big problem .
Are n't you one of the assholes who assured us how Romney was inevitable as the GOP nominee ?
I do n't think Standtorum will tank , its going to be a close one till the very end , I am still rooting for a Romney / McDonnell ticket .
Wow , another Solyndra - type company who took our money and failed in their goal .
They laid off 125 employees , but gave big raises to executives .
Another scam that the media will ignore .
After seeing those bus tours to AIG execs homes , promoted on ACORN 's website , I am wondering why those same people are n't outraged at this .
Maybe because it would look bad for the guy who promises to pay their mortgages , put gas in their tanks , gave them free cell phones and increased the welfare rolls .
Of course , the people on the AIG bus tours likely did n't get soaked with high taxes to pay for this scam , so why should they care ?
This is not surprising or shocking to me .
Obama must pay off his supporters by way of cash infusions and call it " stimulus " money .
He is not lying to call it stimulus .
It stimulates others to be big contributors so they may be in on the next wave of free cash from the boy king .
Another victory for the left because there are more people in need .
The government will rush in and show these people that government dependency is better than working and providing for themselves .
That is the plan with all the liberal policies .
No one should be expected to practice self sufficiency or concern themselves with personal responsibility .
Increase the welfare rolls till the takers outweigh the givers . Only then can socialism creep in .
Everything Obama has done is straight from Alinsky 's Rules for Radicals . All of it .
If some on the left want to remain ignorant and not read Alinky 's book to prove it , that is on them .
For those in the know , this was all quite predicable .
Dumb , dumb dumb ...
I 've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things , but here 's a case where they did it the right way ,
they passed a bill , and Christie the Hutt decides he 's stull sucking up to be RomBot 's running mate .
Christie is being set up on this one and the legislature called his bluff
It will make him a big shot with the GOP in 2012 but by 2016 if he were to run for president " Christie vetoed gay marriage " will be a millstone around his neck .
By 2016 most Americans will have gay marriage available .
Christies denial of marriage privleges to gays will alienate independents and his " I wanted to have the people vote on it " will ring hollow
It is Santorum that is the by far major nonRomney candidate and Newt would appear to be the spoiler .
When the situation was reversed Gingrich argued that Santorum was helping Romney get the nomination and for the good of the conservative cause Santorum should drop out .
Now that the same logic would apply to Gingrich dropping out , should he ?
Sure , why not .
I think Santorum is going to be the last of the " Not Romneys " , and Newt has had his moment .
Who know . He may make a comeback .
Of course money is a problem for him so he may HAVE to drop out .
Santorum or Mitt . I could vote for either one .
No , why should he ?
He is , if nothing else , insuring that he 'll be able to sell books after the election .
I mean you do n't really think that any of these guys really give a shit about their party or their nation , do ya ?
More than they care about themselves , I mean .
Americans ' assessment of Congress has hit a new low , with 13 % saying they approve of the way Congress is handling its job .
The 83 % disapproval rating is also the worst Gallup has measured in more than 30 years of tracking Congressional Job Performance .
Ever notice that the more gridlock there is , the more Congress ' ratings go down .
In other words , Congress should stop all the politcal bickering , put their heads together and start working things out in a real bi - partisan format .
It worked for Reagan and Clinton and look at the positive results .
I 'm not the least bit surprised .
I 'm still waiting for Pelosi to drain the damned swamp .
Today on the Senate floor Durbin said healthcare premiums WILL NOT GO DOWN and that the Administration needs to quit saying that !!!!
Then Nancy Pelosi in the House said we need to pass the Healthcare Bill so " we can find out what 's in it ..... "
The Democrats are slowy turning Congress into Bozo 's Bigtop Circus !!!!!
The insurance industry 's own institute said premiums would skyrocket .
How could they not ?
If you force them to accept pre - existing conditions and accept other insured 's currently not eligible because they cost too much , who is going to pay for that extra risk ?
You ca n't legislate risk away . Of course premiums will rise .
The administration is in campaign mode , willing to say or do anything to get this turd passed .
The joke will be on House Dems who are being promised a bill to " fix " the problems with teh Senate bill .
Anyone who believes that will happen is dreaming .
Obama will hang them out to dry .
1. Ending the war in Iraq
2. Developing American energy independence
3. Universal healthcare for all Americans
Works for me ......
Only if that means it is over because we won .
And we will have some very strategically located , large bases to counter Iranian and Russian agression for the next 50 years .
A good thing , but he will have to include things he opposes , like DRILLING and NUCLEAR power , along with coal power to get there .
Only if he adopts Hillary 's plan of MANDATORY UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION .
Which means EVERYONE , without exception , PAYS premiums .
Here are the things that should be Obama 's top priorities .
#1 Ending the war in Iraq
#2 Bringing us Universal Healthcare
#3 Repealing NAFTA
#4 Repealing The Patriot Act
#5 Repealing Taft - Hartley
#6 Bringing Bush / Cheney up on criminal charges for war crimes . ( send them to the Haig ! ! ! )
#7 Fire John Bolton !
#8 Strengthen the FISA act
#9 Abolish The Office Of Homeland Security !
#10 Prosecute John Ashcroft !
what about when my favorite doctor quits because he is not going to take a pay cut ?
or just lets the quality of his practice go down the tubes ?
also , who is going to goto school for 15 years to be a doctor , with major student loans and only make a sub - par government salary ?
i 'll tell ya what , if were going to goto school for 15 years , it would be for rocket science or computer engineering or something of that nature so i could easily make an above average salary .
last and most importantly , i never want to see any of my paycheck support some lazy person who does not work because the government pays for them to live their life .
I plan on voting against every single one of these dirtbags that call themselves representatives .
Our congress , be it the house or senate , are a bunch of non - representing representatives .
Its as if the British Red Coats were in charge once again doing whatever is best for themselves irregardless of the consitution .
I say kick them all out of office , and then do it again every election for the next several cycles until they get the hint .
WE ARE NOT HAPPY , WE ARE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE !!!!
Am I the only one or are some of you feeling like this too ?
I 'm not a Republican , I 'm not a democrat , I AM AN AMERICAN !!!!!
Start respecting my country , my consitution , and our national heritage or get fired / voted out .
Add your 2 cents people .
I 'll have a Senator to vote for along with my Representative , and Senator Voinovich is not running in 2010 so I 'll luckily have more options to vote for .
So far there are 3 candidates in the race that I 'm aware of , and I 'm not impressed by any of them .
But hopefully somebody good pops up that I can support .
As far as my Representative goes , I ca n't wait to vote against him .
I do n't vote ' against ' anyone .
I vote ' for ' the best candidate for the job , regardless of political affiliation ( unless , of course , they are un - American , like Libtards and Neocons ) .
Since none of the incumbents in my district will get my vote , I guess you could say I 'm voting ' against ' them , but I 'm still not comfortable with that term .
Where would McCain be without Sarah ?
A lot of us , including myself , have had fun poking , jabbing , making fun of Palin , her lack of knowledge about the Constitution , her appearance on SNL , etc. ...
but at this late date in the race ...
Where would he , ( McCain ) , be if he did not have her as his running mate
IMO .... she is helping him more now , because he is hurting himself , more .
Palin solidified the Republican base for McCain .
She invigorated the far right wingers to actually go out and campaign for McCain , instead of apathetically voting for McCain to spite Obama .
Palin is the real star behind the Republican ticket this year .
If it were anyone else , McCain would not have a shot in hell .
Palin invigorated Obama 's campaign , and she is one of the reasons Obama raised $ 150 million dollars in September .
When I saw her speech at the convention , I immediately sent Obama as much money as I could .
Presidential Candidates : Chuck Baldwin ( C ) Constitution Party Bob Barr ( L ) Libertarian McCain ( R ) Cynthia McKinney ( G ) Green Ralph Nader ( I ) Independent Obama ( D )
Looks like women have a candidate running for President .
Why are n't women flocking to her ?
What 's wrong with the Green party ?
The woman is a nutjob .
She would make Ralph Nader look like Barack Obama .
Why on earth would women vote for the Green Party just because they have a female candidate ?
Sorry , I would n't have voted for Hillary , either .
I would vote for Sarah or Condy .
THe Green Party is the party for the libtards who are too crazy even for other libtards .
If the Government provides Health Care , whether spelled out in this bill or not , it will RATION the care .
That is how it works .
The Government can not afford to pay for everything for everyone , even if they took all our money .
And in fact the research that backs up this health care bill out of the House spells it out clearly .
Specifically it identifies the elderly and those under the age of 2 as being less important and so they will be the first to suffer from reduced services .
Knowing that the Government can not efficiently run anything , I can promise it wo n't end there .
Since all healthcare is rationed , the question for me is do I want those decisions to rest with corporations whose sole reason for existence is to make a profit --- profits which depend upon insuring the healthiest among us , and denying coverage for those whom they may have to pay claims ?
Corporations where profits are dependent on NOT providing the services I pay for ?
That can at any point in time decide to cancel my policy , leaving me without any coverage at all and no prospects of obtaining coverage on my own ?
That spend 1/3 of their revenue in administrative overhead ?
I have not seen much cold weather , or snow , here in the northeast .
Meterologist say this will be a warmer than usual winter this year .
Many temperatures have been above what is normal for this time of year .
Is this Winter weather going to be what winters will be like in the future . ?
Warmer temperatures . ?
Is what global warming is about . ?
Hey stupid , Maine 's getting 4-8 inches of snow tonight .
When it snowed in October it was Global Warming too
52nd Street all up in the white .
I see mr. Biker boys . Thanks for letting me know .
Whats the name of that motor cycle gang you belong to ??
Its warmer , therefore Global Warming
It 's snowing , therefore Global Warming
When will it be too late to do anything about global warming ?
Have we already guaranteed our doom ?
So you are a warmist too ehh ?
Sorry to hear .
The facts .... from about 1980 to 1998 we had a 1/3 of a degree warming period .
This started the Man made global warming claim .
Another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd . Since 1998 until today there has been no significant warming .
A further fact . In the early 1900 's scientists predicted that over the next 100 years the temperature would go up globally about 1 degree . And that is what it did .
So we had an 18 year trend that saw a rise of 1/3 of a degree world wide . Followed to date by a 14 year period with no appreciable warming . Remind me again how we are all doomed ?
Experiencing the great platonic year .
Precission of the earths equinox refers to the earth 's axis wobble moving in an unconventional way .
Time period event is a 25765 yrs wobble path .
Notice the ice cap weight shifting it is due to earths own inertia and the sun moon alignment .
This vid indicates inertia shifts in ice not to be due to global warming but due to physics of the earth , sun , moon system .
This inertia of the sun earth moon generates potential physical plate movements on earth , ie earthquakes .
Very cool stuff .
So is this because of global warming or is it Bush 's fault ?
It 's a good thing the polar ice cap is shrinking then right ?
This seems to explain the record snow fall in Siberia and Alaska .
Nobody as yet really understands why periodically earth undergoes geomagnetic reversal . But the wandering magnetic pole seems to have been happening for the last 200 million years .
Happens regularly , and seems to have little effect on the biosphere as a whole .
No unusual events in the paleo record seem to be associated with magnetic reversals .
but everyone knows that what man makes doesnt count huh ?
Not , I suspect , as it relates to magnetic pole shift or drift .
You just know that some ignorant fool is going to blame pollution .
This is really eye opening .
Where are the environmentalists ?
Have you seen the trash along the roads and in the ditches across this county ?
I see chairs couches refrigerators and who knows what else out here in the countryside .
People have no respect for their neighbors and I am talking about Americans here .
If they have no respect for their neighbors or fellow countrymen how can they have respect for themselves ?
Its not everybody but a small segment of our society but the question is how small is this segment ?
Now that is precisely what I am referring to .
Instead of focusing on the filthy habits of illegals violating our border , you go one a mission to deflect .
Not today , pal .
Stay on point !
Whole apartment was shaking .
Far out and funky !
What the hell ?
Two Thumbs said he felt this too in PA.
Nothing here in Birmingham though .
did you think earthquake at first ?
Felt it here just outside of Reading , PA !
Thought I was having a seizure or something at first , till I saw the water in my water bottle swaying back and forth .
The book shelf in my computer room was moving back and forth .
Weird dude .
Was going on for like 20 seconds .
The time of water wars is upon us with the privatization of water resources worldwide by multinational conglomerates who are not accountable to , or suppressible by the local populations they effect , even here in America .
What say you ?
' Flow , ' a documentary on what the privatization of water really means which was the inspiration for me creating this thread .
It brings to light the insane and completely immoral behavior of water corporations ( Nestle , Coke , Pepsi , as well as Suez and Vivendi , and their involvement with the World Bank ) ...
I am never going to buy another Coke , Pepsi , or Nestle product until ...
I am dying of thirst , which is the situation many in the world find themselves in now .
Allowing the privatization of public waters sources is stupid beyond all understanding .
Water is resource of the commonweal and ought never to be allowed to become captured by any private concern .
Right now corporations like Nestles are buying up the world 's best springs to make bottled water .
Allowing this to happen is a perfect example of how perverted our governments have become .
Hey ........ 30 years ago , I was reading about all kinds of hysterical doomsday theories of the extinction of this natural resource or that natural resource .
You get a few decades down the line and realize there are lots of smart people out there who roll out hysterical theories because they know there are millions of suckers out there who 'll buy it in a heartbeat and profit handsomely FTW !!!
My wife works with the GAO a lot and she sent this report over to me .
They report on just how difficult it will be to regulate the amount of CO 2 being released .
http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10818.pdf
Of course it will be difficult .
The energy companies are putting many , many tens of millions of dollars into preventing anything at all from being done .
But we will probably start doing it well after it will make no differance .
Our grandchildren will curse the blindness and greed of this generation .
I went to youtube and checked out the Gulf oil crisis : all of the posts are one month old , or older ...
How many million people post on youtube ?
The first two months there were hundreds of private citizens with their video cams reporting about what was happening in the gulf ... showing everyone firsthand eyewitness accounts of the incompetence of BP and the lack of government response .
Now there are none : zero : nobody has posted one single video on youtube about the gulf oil crisi for one month .
This stinks to high heaven .
Do n't tell me nobody has posted anything on the gulf crisis for one month : there is a media bl ; ackouit going on .
The last time something like this happened that I know of ; was the republican convention in New York for the renomination of Bush Jr for a second term in office .
Would n't that be a YOUTUBE blackout , then ?
I mean , rather than a MEDIA blackout ?
gulf oil spill - Google Search = Plenty of coverage about the oil spill still on the media .
That 's the point : the oil has not been cleaned up : its sunk below the surface : just like all the true facts have sunk out of sight .
The dispersant they used , Corexit ; has destroyed all possibility of cleaning up the oil because it 's made the oil sunk below the surface .
BP 's use of corexit is a quick way of sweeping the problem under the carpet : idiots who do n't see the oil on the surface will assume that there is n't any ecological damage going on .
Instead , the ecological damage to the entire area is now a million times worse than it was when the oil was still on the surface .
The oil beneath the surface : millions and millions of gallons of oil is killing all wildlife , all the fish , all the dolphins , all the crabs , all the shrimp , everything .
To people who do n't live there : the horror of this catastrophe made worse by BP can not be understated enough .
Yes you read that correctly .... lets just assign a number because we want too !
Yeah that 's the ticket !
These clowns commit this fraudulent behavior all the fricking time and old fraud , chris , konradv , trolling blunder and a whole host of others ignore this .
What is so distorted in their fundamental makeup that they can see this desecration of science and ignore it ?
In fact they support and revere it .
Bizarre .
Yes , they have been extrapolating temps for areas where they had no direct measurement . However , as they stated , one should use the NCDC measurements for those areas , if very accurate measurements are desired .
Yet , for all of Watts yapping , none of this changes the fact that the warming continues , and differant agencies have better accuracy in some places than others , depending on the methods used .
Another item concerning Watts .
He is not a meteorologist .
He is a fraud in that department .
Tomorrow , the Employment Situation Report comes out and as usual , there will be idiots claiming the government does n't count people not receiving unemployment benefits , or that the government is n't counting people who should be counted etc.
So let 's discuss .
Question : What exactly do we want to measure and why ?
Answer : We want to measure the Labor Market and how it is changing , especially how difficult it is to get a job .
First difficulty is that not everyone can freely participate in the labor market .
There are laws and barriers afffecting groups of people .
While children can work , there are significant restrictions as to field , hours , changing jobs etc.
At approx age 16 the restrictions are gone , almost all jobs are open for full or part time work .
So we ignore anyone under 16 .
Next group are prisoners . While some " work " it 's not really a labor market system and working or not working are not free choices of entry and exit .
So we ignore prisoners .
Next group are those mentally or physically incapable of working .
While many disabled and those with psychological conditions do work , those who are institutionalized or in long term care ( such as a hospice ) ca n't .
So we ignore those in an institution or long term care .
There remains many disabled who ca n't work but are n't in an institution , but since some can and some ca n't work , there 's no bright line , so we include them all .
Next : Retirees .
Many countries exclude those over the age of 65 .
For a country with mandatory retirement , or generous government pensions , that is sensible as almost all those over 65 do n't need to work and do n't work and including them can distort the picture .
But in the US , there is no mandatory retirement ( except in military / police ) and retirement benefits are not as generous or universal .
So no maximum age limit for us .
Last , military . For a while , they were counted as employed ( 1984-1994 ) but since there 's no free exit and it 's not a market system , including them just raises the number of employed by a fairly constant level , so it 's better to exclude the military .
So we have our population : The Adult Civilian Non - Institutional Population .
How do we divide that up ?
The key is to be as objective as possible .
Since we have to use a survey ( it 's just not possible to do a full count every month ) , any subjectivity will increase our error , so we have to avoid any possible overlaps or judgement calls .
Let 's look at Employed .
Who is employed ?
Some have suggested a minimum number of hours worked , but is that a good idea ?
Plenty of people voluntarily work few hours , or in a particular week only work a few hours . Should we say they do n't really have a job or are n't really working ?
That 's very subjecive . We do n't want to run into cases were someone nomrmally works 40 hours a week , but in the particular week of the survey she only worked 2 hours and counted as unemployed .
So we set a bright line of 1 hour for pay , and also include those as employed people temporarily absent due to brief illness , injury , vacation , strike , bad weather etc.
We can always look at sub groups later .
Unpaid labor .
Some people do n't get paid ( directly ) for work , either charity work or working on a family farm or family business .
Let 's not include charity work , because that 's not really part of the labor market .
But family business / farm is a different story ... the person is either just helping out , ( meaning if they do n't already have another job they would n't take one if they were n't working for family and / or no one would have to be hired in their place ) or they are a substantial part of the business preventing them from another job and filling a job slot no one else can take .
So let 's set a bright line of 15 hours a week and anyone working without pay on family business farm 15 hours or more a week is employed .
What about someone hired but not yet working ?
Many things can happen , so we wo n't call them employed until they 're actually working .
Now for the Unemployed .
In casual usage , this can mean many different things , but what we want is a precise , objective definition .
And what we 're looking for is available workers who are n't working .
This has an impact on the labor market .. supply over demand .
Some people do n't want to work ... retirees , housewives / husbands , full time students , and some people on drugs or alcohol or criminals or lazy .
So let 's not count anyone who does n't want a job .
Should we count everyone who says they want a job ?
They could be lying .
They could be unable to take a job if offered ( meaning they 're not available labor ) .
So what bright line can we set ?
If someone is actually looking for work , sending a resume , going to an interview , on the union list , then we can safely assume that they are really available for work .
But if someone is n't DOING anything about a getting a job , then they 're not available , anymore than someone who does n't want to work .
Sure they may still consider themselves " unemployed " and they may sincerely want to work , but since they 're not available , since they 're not part of the actual supply of labor and ca n't be hired , we exclude them .
So we have our Employed , we have our Unemployed .... this is our Labor Force , our available supply of people who can work or be hired .
Everyone else is Not in the Labor Force .
Since the population tends to grow , for an historical comparison , it 's better to look at rates / ratios / percentages to get a clearer picture .
Labor Force Participation Rate : The Labor Force as a percent of the Population .
This can be largely affected by non - economic factors as the increase of women into the labor force in the 60s and 70s showed , but it gives a good look at how much of the population is trying to work .
Employment - Population Ratio : this tells us the percent of the population that 's actually working .
Again , non - economic factors play a role but looking at the changes can tell us useful things .
Unemployment rate : Unemployed as a percent of the Labor Force .
This tells us how much of available labor ... people willing and able and available to work ... is not being used .
This is all economic factors ... the percent of people trying and failing to get a job .
Does this give a complete picture of the Labor Market ?
Of course not ... it 's not meant to .
It does n't tell us types of job , if people are working as much as they want to , people who do n't believe they would be successful .
But it tells us what we 're looking for : the percent of people who we know for sure can not get a job .
I think that explains the basics .
I 'll be happy to clarify questions or discuss any real issues .
The issue is simple , when 150k jobs are created and you need 250 to maintain ...
Yet the UE rate goes down . 2 % then you have a choice ...
You can make believe things are getting better or you can understand that things are getting worse and deal with it .
You chose to make believe .
Neither side expects the other to be consistant .
I remember the libs making this argument during the Reagan years .
Of course , the real cuteness was during the Carter years during the run up to the 1980 election when the military was added to the employed part of the picture .
Presto , 2 million more employed persons and the unemployment rate when down by a substantial fraction .
that got quietly reversed after the election .
What is important here is that unemployment is no longer the short term thing it has usually been .
We have people looking for work who have been looking for three years or more .
We have folks just plain resigning from the work force and do n't look any more .
People who four years ago had successful careers .
Even under the regime of 99 week unemployment rather than 26 week , we have large numbers who have gone beyond benefits .
To maintain what ?
And does " it " need to be maintained ?
Or you can do actual analysis of the data .
" Jobs " comes from the Current Employment Statistics Survey ( CES ) while Unemployment ( and total employment ) comes from the Current Population Survey ( CPS ) .
The CES is non - farm payroll employment . It excludes agriculture , the self - employed , unpaid family workers and private employees ( private cooks , nannies , maids , etc ) .
So " jobs " may go up 150K , but total employment goes up 300K .
You ca n't directly compare 2 measures that measure different things .
Much of the drop in UE has been for the wrong reasons ... a decreasing labor force .
That was not the case for the January drop .
At best things have been spotty lately ... up and down .
You ca n't just look at one number or one measure and say " things are good " or " things are bad . "
The BEST unit of measure is , I think to determine how many Americans are WORKING .
Instead we get reports on the number of people who SELF REPORTED they are n't working but are looking for work .
To find out all we have to do is ask Bernie Sanders and remember that Obama voted to the left of Sanders while in the Senate .
God help us all if Obama ever got to appoint a liberal inflationist Fed Chairman .
Oh , and we might remember that when their God , Keynes , was asked about the future consequencs of his ultra easy monetary policies he said , do n't worry about the future , we 'll all be dead .
Bernie Sanders : Another very important issue is with unemployment so high , how can we strengthen the Fed 's full - employment mandate [ with inflation ] and ensure that it conducts monetary policy to achieve maximum employment ? [ through inflation ] .
In other words the Fed has a number of mandates and one of them is to control inflation .
But one of them also is to pursue policies that lead to full employment .
Is the Fed doing that in an adequate way ?
Well I would argue that by definition when you have 16 % of people unemployed and underemployed it really is not .
They 'd do exactly what they 've done since 1913 .
Lend out " money " that does n't exist , charge interest for it , inflate the hell out of the currency and line their pockets in the process .
Then , they 'd bankroll endless stupid foreign wars , the socialistic welfare state , massive Ponzi schemes , endless bailouts of states , cities , corporations and foreign nations ....
The same thing a conservative Fed would do , and then they 'd call it brilliant and give obama the credit .
An NGDP target can fix the unemployment problem without resulting in inflation .
That 's a gross misunderstanding of the Keynes quote .
What he 's saying is n't , obviously , that we should n't care about the long run .
What he 's saying is that economists are taking the easy way out only ever considering the long run .
We need not only theories of the long run , but also theories of the short run .
Nobody can " fix the unemployment problem " ....
This is the fatal conceit of socialistic central planners coming out of the chute .
" Global warming is real - it is man - made and it is an important problem . But it is not the end of the world . " - who said it ?
Bjørn Lomborg - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
i think this issue is only valuable for the purposes of supporting commoditization of CO 2. that 's my explanation for why all of the funded scientists point to the gas and build the anthro argument . i dont see how it is credible in light of more dominant causes .
I 'm curious Dante ... Dose n't the temp change by about 40 degrees , every year , in the northern and southern hemisphere ? Also , with warmer temps and more co2 in the atmosphere , would n't the number and variety of plants and trees increase ? What ever happened to the rain forest , nuclear meltdown , ozone layer , global cooling , or any of the other iminent catastrophes that will befall us if we do n't do something RIGHT NOW ! ! ? The only environmental issue important to envronmentalists is whatever one can generate the most money . At least oil companies get their cash by providing us with something we need . You enviro - whackos get yours by doing absolutely nothing at all , except making life harder for everyone else .
In reality humans contribute about 5 % to global worming in terms of CO 2 release into the atmosphere . Yes it is true that we are responsible for this number and trying to minimize it in whatever way we can , but humans are not ultimately the source of global worming . It is arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only 20 years . Science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little . The IPCC has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused . The problem is that they used the same relative data set and simply changed the way it is viewed to maximize the human contribution . They have also been known to falsify information to suit their purposes and destroy information that proves them incorrect .
So it would appear that politics drives natural history and our relation to the ecosystem ... inherent problems there .
Consider too Rapid Climate Change Events as documented by paleoclimatological data from ice cores drilled out of Antarctica and atmospheric analysis of gas frozen in the ice . This heating process occurs every 22,000 years like clockwork for the past 150,000 years that our records go back . Guess what ... it has been just about 22,000 years ... fancy that .
Remember in the 80s when the next ice age was around the corner and we were all going to freeze to death ?
Very simple . Adapting to a rapidly changing climate is preferable to changing our present habits , no matter how destructive they are to the coming generations , or to the rest of the biosphere .
For most people , the present rapid changes are already stretching their abilities to adapt . They see jobs that they considered safe niches now gone forever , with no demand for skills that took years to develop , and now the scientists are telling them that they have to change even more . That we should cease to use fossil fuels asap , that we need to switch to an energy base that features nuclear , wind , solar , geothermal , and other non - polluting sources , that they do not understand , and have no experiance with .
I see otherwise intelligent people convincing themselves of the scientific equivelant of the sun rising in the West simply because they wish to avoid any more changes in the lives , and the way that they live . Which , of course , pushes the changes onto their children , and grandchildren , who will be facing a much more serious situation concerning the effects of a changing climate , a rapidly changing climate , than we face today .
Well , that is the culture of this nation , and our children will suffer the consequences of our inability to face reality .
How long would we live if we could replace body parts with exact matches ?
How about replacing our whole bodies and exchanging brains with that of a clone ?
Someday the micro surgery techiques will be available .
Would you participate ?
I would if it was sure fire .
They are patenting human genes right now .
Perhaps one has an inalienable right to patent ones own body and its specific type .
Do we own our own uniqueness ?
Your thoughts ?
interesting book ... last child in the woods ... talk about how this generation has accepted the merging of man / machine / animals .... that there are about 2000 patented life forms ...
i am not real sure what that means but i am sure xox can explain it ...
i find the idea of " cloning " sillie ...
the so called " clone " is a human from your cells ... not a spare parts factory for you .
are there not still questions concerning the aging of cells in the " clone " animal or person ...
that dollie 's lambs ( remember the sheep that was cloned ) age faster due to her age at the beginning ....
so you would have to clone your infant ...
now tell me .... you have spare infant identical to the one you gave birth too and your not gonna love it ....
now that would be a brave new world .
Would I be able to order clones of Elisha Cuthbert and Jessica Alba that I could keep as sex slaves ?
If so , count me in .
Go ahead and slap a property tax on them too , I 'm good for it .
31 US troops were killed when the Chinook carrying them crashed .
May they rest in peace and condolences to the families and loved ones of these brave young men .
365 Coalition Troops killed this year ? Man , that 's a lot .
I did n't realize the casualties were that high this year .
Our MSM does n't seem very interested in covering the Afghan War much . I 'm really not sure why .
That 's bad but this is the unnecessary war Bush started .
This is war and people die in wars .
Over One Million Iraqi Deaths Caused by US Occupation
This happened in 2010 .
They are the first and only ones , I believe .
They did the same training , made it through .
That is pretty cool .
It 's like the " softest " branch of the military and the toughest assignment together .
So these guys can be sitting in a bar next to some Marines .
Marines say , " so what are you ? "
And they say , " we 're in the Coast Guard . "
And maybe they snicker a little , but they should n't !
What makes people assume the Coast Guard is the softest branch ?
Ignorance ?
Maybe you never served in any Military branch and have no frame of reference ?
Not to diminish the great Navy Fleet Sailors who keep the gigantic ships running with all kinds of technical skills , Coast Guard people are the real Sailors who navigate tiny boats in high seas to rescue people , arrest criminals and keep America 's shores safe .
It 's not surprising that they could complete SEAL training if they wanted to .
I 've been reading through several news sites tonight and I just picked up on a great story about a US Air Force pilot who probably saved a lot of US Military lives in the early goings of the Iraq War .
Now let 's get one thing straight , I initially agreed with the reason for going into Iraq , but I no longer agree with it .
I support Obama 's decision to pull our troops out by next year .
I always , 100 % side with our brave men and women who are putting themselves in harm 's way .
Now today , I came upon this story on TV .
Lieutenant Colonel Victor Fehrenbach .
He was promoted to Lt. Colenel in 2006 .
He 's part of the 325th Fighter Wing Mission that serves off of Tyndall Air Force Base flying F - 15C 's and F - 22 Raptors .
He 's been in the Air Force for 18 years .
He is just 2 years short of retirement .
He 's flown missions in Iraq , Afghanistan , Kosovo and has been awaiting re - deployment a new tour of duty .
If you know anything about air force , he 's Afelm JT Fly Trng .
Back in 2003 this hero won the Air Medal for Heroism .
Back in April , 2003 the Army was making the initial advance to capture Baghdad Int'l airport , Victor and his wingmen found an Iraqi ambush site of about 12 APCs that were less than a mile from the Army advance .
At the time , his wingman was suffering from a major malfunction in his plane that prohibited him from deploying his weapons .
Within a timespan of 20-30 minutes , he and his wingman were finally able to deploy all of their weapons and destroy the 8 APCs that were about to ambush the US Army on their mission to take Baghdad International Airport .
They took out the entire enemy position and that night the Army captured Baghdad International Airport .
Why am I posting this when there have been several hundred if not thousand of other US Soldiers , Seamen and Pilots who have each served their country heroicly and have also won medals , which some have even died for ?
Because this hero was 2 years away from retirement and is being discharged , against his will , from the Air Force . Is this because of bad behavior ? No. He has an excellent record of service and has never had any problems . Then why , if this 18 - year veteran who is an excellent Pilot of the US Air Force being discharged against his will , 2 years before he retires ?
Because he 's openly gay . He 's commanded squadrons , saved other American soldiers ' lives and served with honor .
But because he is different than we are , because he is sexually attracted to men , his sexuality trumps the incredible record of service he 's had over 18 years .
Are you telling me that the most professionally trained , the meanest , the fiercest military in the world that can destroy any other enemy and accomplish any goal its given , can not accept men or women who have different seuxality tastes than other people ?
This Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell law absolutely MUST be repealed immediately !
Men and women who fight to save our country , who are more than willing to die to protect our freedom , must NOT be discriminated against .
It 's time to end prejudice and time to accept human beings for who they are - ESPEICALLY our heroic men and women in the US Military . Support Our Troops !
ALL OF THEM !
In these troubled times we simply can not do without this significant portion of potential enlistees , and talented senior members , to uphold an absurd , and bigoted , policy .
Most absurdly , we are allowing ourselves to fire Arabic language specialists , people whose positions are critical at this time , due to a trait that has no effect on the performance of their duties .
I know congress has a lot on their plates right now , but they need to move on this soon .
Preferably with a solution that would allow soldiers lost to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to .
Its not that the military is against gays .
The military is against things that make it run less efficiently .
Allowing blacks to enter the military increased its numbers and productivity thus the long term goals outweighed the short term unease .
Allowing openly gay men / women into the service would create Long term discomfort and you would see a decrease in troop numbers as well as military efficiency .
Because of the nature of the military and close quarters shared especially among men in war simulation , training and actual warfare the distraction of having someone who you know may be attracted to you can ultimately cause death because you are distracted .
As part of the Army ?
They do pretty much the same things though the Army has the much more elite units and more highly trained infantry .
The Army , as demonstrated by its successful execution of D - Day during WWII , is also capable of making daring amphibious assaults , so why not just disolve the Marines into the Army ?
You are aware that the Marine Corps is the only service that is protected by Congressional Act ?
The Marine Corps must maintain a minimum of 3 Divisions and can not be disbanded without a Congressional act .
This was done in the early 1950 's because of rejects like you .
Because the navy needs bodyguards for the officer corps and a expeditionary force , too .
Leave the fucking Marines alone .
They 're one of the few organizations I still have some respect for in this nation .
To be honest , the Army is a great service .
I have served with several stellar performers from 2ID and 3rdArmored .
Got friends in the 101 and 82nd Airborne or Airmoble .
The bottom line ( and the hook and sinker ) is that man for man , and dollar for dollar the Army can not match the " kick in the door " specialty that our Marines do .
BTW I did a force on force with the 10th Mountain in the late 80 's .
They were attempting to go - light and were using our FMFM 's to teach em techniques .
And besides , they Aint Ready to be Marines Yet .
You just know I have to weigh in on this one !
Each service and the Marines have their unique roles .
There are of course some similarities and overlap between them .
That is what allows the US military great flexibility in operational execution .
Funding will always be an issue .
Each service thinks their requirements are more important than the other service 's .
Because not everything gets funded , we go to war with the military we have and not the military we want .
Obviously , there has been interservice rivalry since the first ship went to sea with fighting men on board .
The army has brotherhood beef with the marines but we recognize that the marines are a unique unrivaled infantry machine .
The Army has the ability to meet any infantry requirement anywhere and is set up for long term missions .
The long term ability of the army mesh 's with the immediate ferocity of the Marines .
They are far from the same and if combined would defeat the purpose of their original designs .
A funny story ( at least to me ) .
I have two sons in the Marine Corp , both of whome recently completed their MOS training and headed to their permanent duty stations .
One of them went through MOS school at Fort Leonard Wood , MO.
He was telling me that the Army trainee 's had top salute the Marines ( no matter their rank ) ....
that to me shows the respect that the Army has for the elite US fighting force ... and a respect that would be lost if they were part of the Army .
He also told me that the Air Force guys got additional pay for being stationed on the same base as Marines and that the Marines were not allowed to go round in groups of more than 4 , because they were concerned about what they could do to anyone .
Be afraid ... be very afraid .... USMC all the way !!!!
Man , how the hell can people do this ??
And a Mother especially ..... where is the Motherly love and the Mother instinct to protect her children ??
Blind rage is just that - blind .
I once found myself holding a steak knife - ready to plunge it into my chest .
And I did , in my mind .
I was already dead .
But by some other force , I did n't .
I still do n't know why .
It was one of but two miracles that I 've witnessed in my life .
Folks black out so to speak .
They black out to one singular vision that is a reality of past present and future . And for that I hold them ( and once myself ) harmless .
Drugs . Valle had over 20 different kinds of drugs she was taking .
It 's a wonder she could find the bathtub .
Neither one will go down in the history books as the best in theirsports ............................
Both were considered shoe - ins duringtheirprime
I want to say something else too though .
I watched a documentary about Tyson once , it was one that focused more on his fighting career than his personal life .
My god , as a boxer that young man was simply awesome - and that is not a word that I use very often .
If I remember correctly he won 19 out of his first 20 professional fights by first round knock out , generally consummated by a left - upper - cut struck on the jaw that would lift a 220 - pound man two feet off the mat .
Its impossible to compare athletes from different eras .
In golf alone the equipment is so much better now than it was even 10 years ago let alone 20 or 30 years ago .
Its also impossible to compare the competition levels .
I do n't think Tyson was ever slated to be the greatest boxer of all time .
Regardless of his skills , he never had the competition during his era to be considered the greatest
Ali defeated Liston , Frazier , Norton and Forman who were all better than anyone Tyson ever faced
I found out today that the Blockbuster Video that I go to is closing down .
This is the fourth store in my area to close in the last year , and I 'm actually a bit upset about it , because the few that remain are n't close enough to drive to .
Blockbusters already drove the mom and pop videostores out of business , and they are being driven out by movies on line , movies on demand , and movies by mail - businesses they are trying to get into .
I guess some would call this progress , but I think we are losing something as well .
Redbox is a simpler version of Blockbuster , in that you can still go to a Redbox and browse and get a movie right then and there .
I actually prefer the Redbox because it does n't have nearly as much selection .
Enough but not so much that I stand there for an hour , you know ?
All of the Blockbusters around us closed down .
You can get some great deals on movies / tv shows as they unload their inventory .
They drop the prices each week so if you 're looking for something in - particular , nows a good time to keep an eye out for it .
Also , when ours closed down they offered a free movie ( that you were buying anyways , I think whatever the cheapest movie you were purchasing ) and a month free of Blockbuster online ( it 's like Netflix ) .
You can just cancel before the one month timeframe is over .
I took them up on the offer ... good deal .
For me , part of the fun of renting movies was going to the store with your chick and picking them out , bullshitting with other people in the store , etc.
God forbid we have to leave the house for an hour and move our limbs .
What guy hears about a little boy being raped and dose n't call the cops .
The guy that notified his superiors , who should have called the cops .
Fire them all
I assume he assumed after reporting it up the chain that something would be done .
I do though think the school made the right move last night , just wish Joe had been able to go out on a more positive note after what he 's done for nearly fifty years at PSU .
Wish him a long and happy retirement .
How interesting is this .
Some guy is going to tweet WWII in " real time " as it happened way back when .
I imagine you could tweet vintage WW 2 headlines daily but not much else .
The minutiea of such an undertaking are indeciperable .
This quest is noble .
Julia Gillard has beaten her predecessor Kevin Rudd in a ballot for the federal Labor leadership by a margin of 73 votes to 29 .
Follow events as they happen on our live blog .
2. Rudd has said he would retire if he lost .
Now is not the time to be bickering with an election coming .
4. I 've been in New Zealand the past two weeks ...
... where the Australian political story has been top news .
The local papers are of the opinion that , whomever won the leadership contest , the Labour Party was likely to be heavily damaged going into next year 's elections .
Local OWS activists were part of this protest .
File this under " Holy S * * * ! "
Hundreds of protesters from various groups converged on the state capitol in Topeka , Kansas today .
Shortly before the protesters arrived , Capitol Police discovered a truck laden with explosives parked outside the capitol .
Yeah , this sounds like bullshit .
One , the protesters were not targeted .
That 's an invention of the blog reprinting this .
Second , I have a really hard time believing that there were any ACTUAL " explosives , " since the news story they link to talks about one guy getting arrested for THREATENING Governor Brownback .
Nothing about explosives charges , etcetera , which they 'd be quick on top of if there were any actual explosives .
Given the way these stories get exaggerated , " several improvised explosive devices " could mean anything down to a few bundles of firecrackers -- or nothing at all , since false reports are n't at all uncommon .
Doubly so since they apparently did not even bother to tow the truck , so clearly there was n't a serious threat .
Translation out of hype - speak : some kook made threatening noises at Brownback and got arrested . The end .
Of what Am I trying to convince you ?
I 'm expressing my own views here .
What you believe is of concern only in terms of debate .
And possibly adding to my knowledge if I 'm convinced there 's justification .
So far , NOT .
If that article represents the final word on " substance " to you , that 's fine with me .
I am , and remain skeptical .
I 'm sure they found something .
Hard to make any case at all without something tangible .
What it is , who put it there , and why remain , for me , unknown , and also remain deciding factors for me .
Wingnut / Hard for me to grasp . Goodness , disagreeing with you causes personal attacks . Not hard to believe when considering the weakness of your argument .
This is excellent news , we needed a counter balance !
It was revealed in January that Rupert Murdoch / News Corp were creating the right wing spanish version of Fox News .
1. what makes u think these channels will be a counter balance to anything lol nt
2. Because when all else fails , I still trust in Mickey !
3. Disney 's ABC Network has been rated the second most conservative news coverage .
Still , a conservatively biased channel is preferable to a conservative propaganda channel , which is what the Fox Spanish channel will certainly be .
4. How is Univisions coverage ?
I understood that it was a center left network .
I turned on my coputer this morning and instead of opening the internet to my Google home page ( White ) it opened to a page called " Blackle " which was black .
I thought , hmm , they do funny things with the Google letters for holidays , so maybe today is Blackle Wednesday or something .
I " Blackled " it and found out they changed the page to black to save energy .
Does this make sense ?
Any teeth to this and if so , does it make enough of a differrence for web developers to switch ?
I just Googled Google and when I click on the first selection it takes me to the white Google page , so apparently we still have a choice .
The new search from Google has the Blackle.com address , not google .
Also , when we have a choice for skins , like I think we do ( or did at one time ) here on A 2K , then we could all contribute to the energy savings by using the black skin , right ?
So , we could participate that way , too .
( Although I find the black page harder to read . )
Anyone familiar with the workings of energy that could explain the black page using less ?
Or , whether or not it is that significant ?
Only so long as they have no redeeming qualities , I imagine .
It is always wrong to kill anybody , whatever they have done .
I heard it costs upwards of one million dollars to execute one prisoner ; that sure buys a whole lot of years in prison .
A concurrent thread has touched on the the role of religion in the US Civil Rights movement , and its place in the US constitution .
Is the " equality " issue " religious wish fulfilment " which flies in the face of biological and sociological " fact " ?
I think you are answering if two men are the " same " and not necessarily if they are equal in rights or should be .
T K O
I see equality as a goal to strive for , although in effect , it is somewhat arbitrary , dependant on the whims of changing times .
While riding the bus earlier this week , I overheard a man say that if he " had the guts to do it , " he would jump off an overpass .
He followed up with an affirmation that he would never do it because he would never find those guts .
We are probably all familiar with the traditional saying regarding suicide - that it is a " coward 's way out . "
My question is this : Is it really ? Or is it the opposite ?
That is , does the act of suicide actually require courage to commit ?
Personally I believe it requires a tremendous amount of courage and perhaps the greatest amount of courage of any possible action .
After all , we are speaking of terminating one 's own life , perhaps forever ending one 's existence .
We all have our thoughts on what comes next , but no one can be certain .
One may be forever ending his existence , or he may be forever subjecting himself to punishment if the religious views on suicide being a sin are correct .
Either way though , one is entering the unknown by willingly terminating his life , which blatantly violates the biological drive to live , to continue existing .
How can this not be an extremely courageous act , much more so that " finding the courage to remain alive in the face of unbeatable problems ? "
Remaining alive to face one 's problems is continuing the state of existence that one has always known .
Ending that life is journeying into something new , something that may be better or may be worse than the current state of existence the individual is comfortably familiar with .
Either way he is terminating his life and accepting the state of death that deep down we all fear .
How can one consider voluntarily entering that state cowardly ?
@Elmud , Well , I think your reasoning has merit :
[ INDENT ] One is fearful of some thing One overcomes their fear to do that thing In so doing , one can therefore said to have courage [ / INDENT ]
So yes ; strictly speaking , I think you 're correct .
Although I must admit , it strikes me as very unproductive to give praiseworthy words to such an act .
" He had the courage to kill himself " ; though correct in this sense , leads to a ' destructive ' conclusion .
As a side note , labeling it as a " cowardly " or " easy " way out - I think - is simply people using derision to express their disapproval .
Such disapproval may be certainly warranted - and I disapprove of it generally - but what one must go through ( mentally , emotionally and / or experiencially ) can hardly be called " easy " .
I can also envision a state where , for me , such a solution could be warranted ; not a good one to be sure , but conceivable nonetheless .
To fight with every last stitch of breath for even the most - remote possibility for " things getting better " is what I hold to .
Interesting twist on the issue . Thanks for posting
@WithoutReason , It is a purely courageous act , especially if you prepared for it so that it was least painful for your loved ones .
I do n't know if it could be argued as a logical choice , per se , especially if you had not yet tried letting go of all the things that bring you down ( psychologically speaking ) .
But , if you just got your arms and legs blown off by and IED , then by all means , have at it . ( Err ... have someone do it for you . )
According to most analyses , from within and without the petroleum Industry , the world supply of oil , relative consumption , will effectively peak in the next decade .
What does this mean ?
If demand exceeds supply , someone will neccessarily have to go without .
The issue is who ?
Some nations will be priced out , most likely the relatively undeveloped countries in which automotive transportation is not really essential .
However , when there is not enough oil to satisfy even the industrialized nations , which totally depend on oil not only for transportation , but for farming , various chemicals industries , etc. , how will they likely respond ?
Obviously , war is a possiblity ; they have been fought for far less in the past .
Of course , access to petroleum itelf is not the only issue .
Most of the world 's food is grown using modern farming methods that require enormous amounts of gas .
If the amount of surplus food suddenly decreases as a result of peak oil , the poor around the world will starve , lamentable in itself , causing instabilities that could lead to conflict over scarce resoures .
China comes to mind .
The economy of that nation is being built , with questionable logic by the central planners , on the western model : i.e. dependent on cheap petroleum .
What is unique about China is that the ruling party 's legitmacy is intimately assosciated with rapid economic progress .
If this were suddenly to halt or risk collapse , would that ruling party push the country into war , either to acquire access to oil or simply as a distraction , as so many authoritarian regimes have done in the past ?
There is shift of power occuring in Asia , as China and Russia exert their influence .
The Shangai Cooperation Organization of which they , along with Ian , Pakistan and most of the former Soviet republics , are memebers , has stated that it intends to remove U.S. influence from the region and failitate the rise of a ' multi - polar world . '
I do n't want to guess their specific motives , but it seems to me that such an arrangement could be very advanategous for those nations in the event of a crisis brought on by peak oil .
Between Russia and Iran , they would have access to enormous oil reserves , from which they could , if supplies were too short , deny the U.S. Saudi Arabia comes to mind as well .
As anyone who has done even the most superficial research on that nation would know , the House of Saud is a joke , a paper tiger and a tyranny hated by most of its people .
If elections were held their , or if there was a struggle for power , the regime that woudl arise would be friendly with Iran and extremely antagonistic to the U.S. : quite understandably I might add .
With the largest oil reserves in the world , it is vital that the U.S. maintain contorl over Saudi Arabia , which means propping up the House of Saud , and it would be equally benificial to Iran or to China and its partners in Asia to facilitate a revolution there , which would allow them greater access by default .
And so , after all that , which you might justly consider paranoia , my question is basically this ; in light of the threat of peak oil , and of the general decline in American economic might relative the rest of the world ( not to mention the current U.S. crisis ) , what do think the world will look like in a decade or two ?
If American hegemony fails , as appears inevitable , what will be its replacement ?
Nice post and important issue .
I really , really hope that alternative sources are being as enthusiastically - pursued as the urgency of the situation dictates they should .
But the first , perhaps facetious , response I had to " what would happen " - question was to recall the 80 's movies : Mad Max , and Mad Mad : Road Warrior
I 'll admit though : There 's a part of me that wants to see all this fossil - fuel B.S. come tumbling down .
Even if it set transportation , technology and civilization in general back some , I 'd think a " reboot in a better direction " ( read : away from finite resources , fossil fuels ) is so much the better .
Yea , more war over oil resources is likely ; perhaps even inevitable .
There is no question that the coming century will see a confluence and will be a critical turning point in human history .
Peak oil will be one of the primary drivers of this process .
We may very well be called upon to choose between collective life and death .
The potential is there for both .
If we so choose to do so the technology we will have available in the near term future is perfectly capable of salvaging the situation .
But if we do n't and we allow our technological civilisation to collapse under its own weight , the next generations of humans will have to do without the major stepping stone of an oil based economy .
There simply will not be enough oil left .
They may not be able to kickstart their own industrial era .
I think what you are going to see is a shift towards localized economies .
As the oil supply becomes smaller and population grows there just will not be enough to feed the system .
Hopefully , people realize that it is going to take oil to move beyond oil , so the focus should be using what is readily available wisely , before the shift becomes extremely expensive .
I just Read of Arthur C Clark 's death in Sri Lanka -- he is primarily know as a science fiction author , but his science fiction presaged many of the technologies that we now consider plebian .
His prediction of geosychronous satellites in the 40 's are now so utilitarian that this 24 hour equatorial orbit is now known as the Clark orbit ,
Many other of his ' fictions ' have now become casual technology .
I remember when he did that show " mysterious universe " about enigmas and theories about things like Easter island , great pyramids , and Stonehenge .
Great man , great body of work , a truly enlightened soul who will revisit us again I 'm sure .
See you in the blink of an eye , buddy .
This was sad news .
I enjoyed his books and his perspective on things .
Another giant gone .
Shame nobody ( except a quoted person ) spelled his name right .
I could n't for the life of me figure out where to post this question , so I thought I 'd put it here since it 's biologically relevant ... somewhat .
Do n't ask me why but I need to know what happens if you dye your eyebrows .
Say you want to disguise yourself by bleaching dark hair blonde and that you wanted to do the eyebrows as well to complete the disguise .
Now the hair on your head will eventually grow and you 'll lose the blonde - ness , but what about the eyebrows ?
I do n't remember ever having them cut or trimmed , so would they stay blonde ?
Eyebrows have a different " terminal length " than head - hair -- that is , they grow to a certain length ( and not longer ) , then fall out .
They 're still going through the growth process , though .
The old ones fall out , the new ones fall in .
So it 'd have to be re - done at intervals , yep .
This excessive concern with little eyebrows is a trifle odd .
I do n't think soz is looking to disguise herself .
I think she 's on the vamp .
According to Darwin it is the males who do the vamping .
What 's the scientific explanation of the reversal in humans ?
Its the same with long - haired dogs and short - haired dogs .
The short haired dog has hair strands that ( on the average ) fall out or break before the average long - haired dog 's .
Eyebrow hairs grow much slower than head hair , so if you dye everything together , your head hair will show " roots " long before the eyebrows do .
I dye my eyebrows all the time , whether I 'm doing a touch up to the roots , or my entire head .
So , that 's every 2 weeks .
I do n't know how fast my eyebrows grow , but after 2 weeks there 's always a grey one in there somewhere .
I guess they grow as fast as women seem to need to pluck them .
BTW , when you 're dying them , use a Q - tip , and make sure you get it all the way to the root .
I rather suspect that the " there is a GOD who always was -- and the GOD created what we see and can infer exists " scenario has more appeal forl you .
Am I correct ?
A " Theory " is nothing more than an explanation of known facts ... when and if the facts change , the theory would be expected to change . Therefore , any proposed " Theory " that is not supported by known facts is to be rejected . However , support for any one theory does not
automatically lead to a rejection of a second or even a third if those
theories are also supported by the facts .
Facts , not interpetations , are the basis for evaluation . An open and
curious mind and a regard for truth are still the basis for good science .
Media coverage and political support are not .
It 's a common argument that the Universe is tuned " just so " for life to exist , and that any slight modification means that " life " would be impossible .
But this premise assumes that life as we know it is the only form of life that * can * exist . And I disagree with this assumption .
The life we see around us evolved in this Universe as conditions allowed , so it 's not surprising at all that everything fits nicely . Other Universes with different rules would necessarily have life in them which fits that universe . And Universes which are sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they are not there .
The really interesting thing to realize is that life evolves in Universes ( at least this one ) at all . Is the evolution of life in a Universe pure chance , or is it inevitable ?
In our universe at least , life not only can exist , but does exist . And that means that our Universe is itself , alive , in a very real sense . And we are its thoughts .
A variant on the multi universe which seems to me obvious , and very real , is the infinite universe .
Here the universe that we perceive is simply one cell of infinity , the others being like or unlike " cells " beyond our own , but filling the remainder of " everything " beyond our specific " this " with " otherthings " , identical , or not .
If we look at the magnitudinal stratification of this universe we go from , as we interpret it , and with our current ability to decern at sub nano levels , the smallest subatomic particles through atoms , molecules , solids , constructs , and on , and on , and on , to planets , star systems , galaxies , and on to our entire known universe .
Would it not be foolish to assume this " Mandelbrot " like lattice would stop at the extreem of our meagre ability to observe , rather than continue to follow its serial makeup to unimagined levels of structure , and beyond to infinity ( infinity , of course not being a point , but rather a lack of constraint quantifier ) .
multiverse
I was working on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while I enjoyed the incoherent rambling argument on whether there is a god or not Im feeling kind of empty . The universe is the way it is because if it werent then we wouldnt be able to contemplate on whether therte is a god or not . And trying to justify the existence of god through anything dealing with relativity is laughable . God is only able to exist through faith . And faith goes against everything that science stands for .
A key issue in disscussion of " life " and " universes " is what constitutes " structure " or " order " . For example , to take BGW 's ( and Capra 's ) fractal model of embedded " structures " we are still left with the regression problem of " who observes / defines such structure " .
My own conclusion is that terms like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " events " in the single universe . I am saying that the occurence of " life " is not an " event " in the usual sense because events presuppose " observers " who classify them as such . ( Observation in " our minds eye " is cognitive sleight of hand ) Note also the term " multi " implies " one who classifies or counts " and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ?
In short , the corollary the universe appears like it is because we are like we are is equally valid .
The transcendent question is of course " what constitutes explanation " and how can this encompass the interaction of observer and observed ?
Rather than take a reductionist view proposing infinite , slightly different universes that somehow interact ( alah M - Theory ) , allow for strong emergence via the Landauer - Lloyd analysis of flaws in the of the Laplace 's demon argument that supports reductionists . Basically this states the final outcome of a system may not be soley defined by outcomes written into the basic laws of physics * a gazzillion atoms , but there can be " a cosmic imperative " written into the laws of nature ( Paul Davies - Macquarie Uni - Sydney , Australia - Emergent biological principles and the computational resources of the universe , Complexity vol 10 ( 2 ) , p1 "
So basically ultra complex systems can produce wierd outcomes ; such as rocks , intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw materials - simply arranged slightly differentally . This might bring down the number of universes required to create life from infinite to merely fairly large !
Can we PLEASE get these people a voice in Washington ?
How long are we supposed to wait to see if this womans brain will ever rewire effectively before we move on ?
We Americans have let our victim fetish get so bad that we are pathetic .
If I were in AZ - 08 , I think this would be a fair question but I 'm not sure of what the mechanism to remove a Congresswoman is other than the ballot box .
Strom Thurmond was not all there but still held his office with the consent of his constituents .
I think as long as her constituents are ok with it , we do n't get a say .
As Butrflynet pointed out , Gabrielle Gifford 's office is doing quite a lot .
That does n't seem incidental or trivial to me .
Gabrielle Giffords was voted in because people agreed with her policies and approach to politics .
She hand - selected this group of people who now make up her office , with the intent of working together to implement her vision .
In that way , she is still the representative , as these people take her stated vision and priorities and work to make them happen .
If Giffords is unable to recover fully before the next election , I think it would make sense that her second - in - command , or whomever has been most instrumental in the work that her office has been doing since the injury , goes ahead and runs in her place .
I think engineer 's point about not encouraging removal from office by gunshot is a good one .
The members of the minority party in the House of Representatives are largely ciphers anyway , although only a few of them have the excuse that they suffer from medically certifiable brain damage .
All the Democrats in the house could take a year - long vacation and the results would largely be the same , so Giffords 's absence from her duties is hardly consequential .
Indeed , the country would benefit if more congressmen could be induced to take extended breaks from their duties .
It might be a good idea to keep track of this woman . Some basics from her wiki biography might be helpful .
The Congresswoman , who is about to turn 55 , was born in Iowa . When her parents divorced , she moved to Minnesota with her mother . She worked in a kibbutz after high school , attended Winona State University , the now defunct law school at Oral Roberts University and the William and Mary Law School where she took a master 's degree in tax law .
She has been married for 30 years . " Bachmann and her husband own a Christian counseling clinic in Stillwater , Minnesota .
Bachmann also has an ownership stake in Waumandee , Wisconsin farm land . Since the death of her father - in - law , the farm and its buildings have been rented out to a neighboring farmer who maintains a dairy herd on the farm . From 1995 through 2006 , the tenant - farmer received $ 251,973 in federal subsidies , chiefly for dairy and corn price supports . "
Initially a Democrat , she became disillusioned with Jimmy Carter . In 1976 , the CHristian documentary by Francis Schaeffer , " How Should We Then Live ? " impelled her to take up an anti - abortion stance and she and her fiance began praying outside abortion facilities .
" In 1993 , Bachmann and other parents started a K - 12 charter school in Stillwater , and she began speaking against a state - mandated set of educational standards , which propelled her into the world of politics .
Bachmann became an outspoken critic and opponent of Minnesota 's School - to - Work policies . In a 1999 column , she wrote : " School - to - Work alters the basic mission and purpose of K - 12 academic education away from traditional broad - based academic studies geared toward maximizing intellectual achievement of the individual . Instead , School - to - Work utilizes the school day to promote children 's acquisition of workplace skills , viewing children as trainees for increased economic productivity . " *
* My reaction : what a surprise .
I love Michele Bachmann !
With any luck , she will be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential race .
A dream opponent for the dems , really .
Now , if her running mate were to be someone named Turner , the dems could be in trouble , like , a Bachmann - Turner ticket would blow them off the road once the campaign got into overdrive .
Doubt if she 'd adopt an anti - vocational ed stance , though .
All I know , is the more I see her on television , the better .
Youtube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAaDVOd2sRQ
@33export ,
I 'm not certain that everyone will " get " the reference to Bachmann - Turner . The Canadians , however , will .
@plainoldme ,
It made me laugh ( and I am American ) .
Thats only because you aint seen nothing yet .
@maxdancona ,
My comment was simply a reply to the backhanded reference to BTO .
IMHO , Michele Bachmann is not as sharp as a bowling ball and has no business even thinking about running for President .
I love watching Michele Bachmann . She is funnier than any sitcom on television . Bad thing is she makes Mitt Ronmey look very solid . I mean , compared to Palin and Bachmann , Romney sounds like Einstein LOL .
@jcboy ,
I believe that Bachmann has a real chance of beating Romney for the nomination . I think it will come down to the two of them , and Romney 's negatives , from being a Mormon to having taken so many positions in the past that annoy conservatives .
A " selection of recent articles on the Republican presidential wannabe and Tea Party darling " , from the New Statesman HERE
@Walter Hinteler ,
As amusing as a Bachmann candidacy would be , itll never happen . There are some intelligent people in the RNC who realize that this would be tantamount to handing over the presidential race to Obama without firing a shot . The RNC is scared that the public may love her like they do Sarah . With the GOP trying to find its " center of mass " they are p [ arading out these clowns that can only cause them big trouble in November 2012
It 's that time again .
Politicians running for mid - term elections are attacking their opponents and in doing so , stretching truths where ever they may be found .
I want to get a list of fact check websites going .
It 'd be interesting to see if different sites come up with the same facts ....
i figure someone should just start a website called They All Lie dot com and just post pics of all the candidates , that would certainly make it easier
I 'm kind of cynical that fact even matter anymore .
We 've left the information age , we are well into the opinion age .
That idiotic GOP " Pledge to America " was ripped to shreds by Factcheck.org , but it wo n't matter because those who believe it ( or at least believe in the idea of it ) wo n't ever dare venture near a fact checking source .
I think we need a new web service that fact checks , but also tracks who comes and reads the facts .
You must have been reading the Pledge to America , in which the GOP promises to return the country to failed Bush policies of borrow and spend and the elimination of oversight and regulation .
It was his policies that brought us a net job loss over ten years ( first in history ) , banks that became , in essence , hedge funds , sleazy sub - prime mortgage loans , torture , corruption , etc.
Moreover , privatizing social security and Medicare is a prescription for disaster .
( Check with the Brits who went through this relative to their version of social security . )
While the hostilities between internal factions of the clerical regime and their feuding over the sham election is escalating , the people of Tehran , particularly young people , demonstrated in their thousands in different parts of the city including Fatemi Street , Vali - Asr Street and Square , Vanak Square , Shariati Street , Takht - e - Tavoos Street and Sa'adatabad against the illegitimate and fraudulent election .
Whereas I take every single word uttered by Israel with a grain of salt the size of Jupiter , even I can smell the stink from that election .
Dear Fellow American , This 4th of July , while you and your family celebrate the 230th Anniversary of the founding of our great nation , there 's one party you wo n't be invited to ...
... And that 's the party that Kofi Annan is throwing at United Nations headquarters in New York -- using your tax dollars -- for nearly fifty dictatorships , six terrorist states , governments that endorse execution based on religious faith , and a multitude of other nations from around the globe .
You see , this party is n't to honor your freedoms -- but to conspire to take them away .
Over our July 4th holiday , on American soil , they are preparing to enact a legally - binding treaty that would give the U.N. unchallengeable power to ban civilian ownership of ALL firearms .
That means your rifles , your shotguns and your handguns . AND YOUR FREEDOM !
To learn what you can do to stop the U.N. 's global gun ban treaty - before it destroys our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms visit www.stopungunban.org .
Just as a handful of patriots fired the " shot heard ' round the world " at Concord Bridge , it 's up to you and me and every patriot who cherishes our Bill of Rights to tell the world today that our nation will not be bullied by the U.N.
Thank you for acting today .
Throw ' em out , and drop out .
This organization has been financed with U.S. tax dollars since its inception , and all it does it feed off of the money and try to kill the host . F --- ' em .
Odd , such an extensive website about the threat of this global gun ban treaty , a dozen webpages at least -- and it doesnt actually seem to have a single link to the actual text of said proposed ban .
Do n't those NRA members want to check out for themselves what the text actually says ?
Do n't you think it 's odd ?
Do n't you want to know what that ban treaty actually says ?
The treaty can be found here ..
It seems that LaPierre is in support of criminals based on the what this treaty does .
Try reading the UN treaty when you sober up cj ..
you might find it is n't even close to what you desperately want to think it is .
What makes you think the NRA lets little facts like that get in the way of stirring up fear ?
Like the UN is going to actually demand that we close our firearm factories , and they are just going to lock the doors because of this treaty .
Lethal injection Electric chair Gas Chamber Hanging Firing Sqaud
Who cares , would you rather have your hard earned tax dollars spent by keeping them behind bars .
I would n't .
Lethal injection followed by hanging .
Firing squad is probably pretty quick , but I do n't know that it 's used much .
The electric chair and gas chamber are nothing short of barbaric .
On the ballet I filled out yesterday , there was a Constitution party running for president .
I tried to look up their website , but it was blocked at work .
So this even peaked my curiousity even more ( as the other candidates websites are not blocked ) .
Anyone have a clue ?
Here is their mission statement .
Interesting - I have n't heard of them before and was curious .
What could have been so offensive that the website was blocked ?
Obama 's view that affirmative action should , after these many years , continue may lead to his defeat in November .
And this may be the correct result .
Affirmative action equates to discrimination against nonbeneficiaries , usually while males . Obama says he is against quotas , but so - called goals are invariable set up .
Moreover , the goals are a euphemism for quotas .
Obama should assidiously avoid the AA term and instead embrace programs the benefit the economically disadvantaged , regardless of race , gender , or ethnic origin .
Depends on how it 's framed .
By far , the largest group benefiting from affirmative action is .... wait for it ..... WHITE WOMEN .
Affirmative action has been essential in allowing women to break into some high paying , male dominated fields .
Many of these fields are clearly still male dominated in the management areas .
All Obama has to do it make the point , repeatedly , that McCain 's position is anti - women and he is for increasing the roles women play in the workplace and he 's got a winner .
What is telling is that even when talking about Obama 's " defeat " the other guy never gets mentioned .
If this prediction were true I would think one would consider it what 's his name 's " victory " rather than Obama 's defeat .
They ca n't both lose ...
The funny thing is that more Americans support Affirmative Action than oppose it ( this Gallup Poll shows 49-43 in favor of AA for racial minorities ) .
The Conservatives do n't understand that turning the majority of Americans into " liberals " is not a good electoral strategy ( as they saw in the 2006 elections and will see again in November ) .
I 'm always surprised to see affirmative action discussed in terms of liberal / conservative .
My brother , who is a General in the US Army , self identifies as conservative but is a BIG believer in affirmative action .
I self identify as a moderate liberal and definately identify as a woman am not nearly the supporter he is .
So I 'm just going to read along to see if the why of this being a liberal v. conservative issue becomes any clearer ......
Quotas are racist .
There is no getting around it .
They are a means of making a choice based on race .
Why does it surprise anyone that Obama would support quotas ?
Obama is n't against ALL racism , just some of it .
Are Those Who Question 9/11 Anti - Semites ?
Anti - semitism is one of the most frequent allegations levied by defenders of the government 's version of 9/11 against people questioning that account .
Is it true ?
Are 9/11 activists really anti - semites ?
Not anti - semites .
Just anti - logical
So out of the 70 million American voters who say we need new 911 investigations there are no Jews ?
Not likely .
This post is based on the incorrect statement that :
" Anti - semitism is one of the most frequent allegations levied by defenders of the government 's version of 9/11 against people questioning that account . "
No. Anti - Semitism is not the most frequent accusation against those that question the governments explanation of 9/11 .
Only when obvious anti - Semites try to say " the Jews did it , " might that allegation made .
And , that I thought was a version of 9/11 that is accepted in many Muslim countries as the most popular notion .
Unfortunately , anti - Zionism and anti - Semitism have been melded in the popular culture by many people .
So , anti - Zionists often become anti - Semites , rather than do the intellectual efforts to parse the two concepts .
I saw Clinton on a show this weekend .
When asked why no economists support her tax holiday plan , she said they were elitists who do n't understand the pain the common man is in .
Just to review , Clinton and McCain have proposed eliminating the federal gas tax of $ 0.18 / gallon during the summer driving season .
McCain says he will pay for it with spending reductions , Clinton with taxes on oil companies .
Obama ( and all economists ) say this is a bad idea and results in insignificant savings .
There is no support for this in Congress and the President has denounced it .
If the tax is repealed , several commentators feel the refiners will take some for themselves since they have also been hurt by rising prices .
What burns me is the " elitist " comment applied to economists .
We tell our children to work hard , get a good education and become experts in their fields , but if they disagree with a politician , they become latte drinking elitists out of touch with the hard working common man .
Is n't this just what Bush has done to the scientific community in miniture ?
Is n't advice from experts required to run a country like the US ?
I 'm sure there are some economists of priviledge out there as well as some who propose solutions based on theories without regard to the impact of their ideas , but Clinton does n't have any economists who support her proposal , so what 's the deal ?
( I do n't know about McCain 's beliefs since Clinton has been doing the heavy lifting so far . )
interesting I think , is the poll released this morning on MSNBC detailing that 45 % think the gas tax holiday is a good thing while 49 % think it 's bad .
whatever , I think it 's just plain sleazy .
Engineer Engineer , I repeat my response on another of your topics .
I agree with you and Dyslexia .
Hillary Clinton 's desperation " gas vacation " proposal is about the last straw with me .
She has really demeaned herself as far as I 'm concerned .
It 's not only her pandering , it 's that the proposal is so stupid .
The oil companies would end up with the money by raising their prices and the public would get nothing .
Hillary Clinton for Senate Majority Leader is now my choice for her . BBB
Clinton and McCain are trying to win votes with nickle and dime stuff ;
our economy is straining so badly , it needs more than $ 600 tax rebates or one - time summer relief from taxes ;
it 's called a ) saving homes of millions of families , b ) our economy , and c ) the war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Some dunderheads will fall for these gimmicks , and vote for them in November .
I have gone thru countless elections and many things are said in the heat of the campaign .
Hillary once elected might go not thru with it .
That is not to say she lied but that wiser heads may counsel her to pass it up .
Where is Dick Cheney ?
Why has he deserted ?
His absence has been explained many times in many different ways , but he has virtually disappeared from the scene .
This would n't be so important , but he still is the vice president , is n't he ?
Things are looking very muddled right now .
Rumsfeld , who was enjoying a limelight , is now being asked to keep a low profile , since his abrasive personality has alienated so many .
Poor Bush , no matter how many times they parade him , still is n't impressive .
And Powell is beginning to look like a desperate man in search of some dignity .
A lot of public appearance is left to Ari Fleischer , which is his job , but he does n't exactly have such an ingratiating personality either .
Which does n't leave us very much in the way of impressive - looking leadership .
So where is Cheney ?
He 's in the underground command center ....
he 'll resurface soon ...
Maybe he is in a cryogenic chamber right next to Ted Williams .
In other words they are keeping him on ice .
moonlighting for Haliburton
weird , is n't it .
i 've been wondering where he wandered off to .
He 's been ' off the radar ' for a long time .
But he told us all at the outset that this is the way it would be .
He is spending time in the bowels of Hell with his real boss , plotting and planning .
Yes and getting richer by the day .
Maybe a low profile because his name is now showing up in Arabic and European papers regarding that very same Halliburton bit ?
As Reagan would say here we go again .
K - Mart is closing 326 stores and laying off approximately 35,000 people .
It is almost a daily ritual with the announcement of massive layoffs .
President Bush on the other hand continues to claim the economy is strong , not as strong as it could be but strong nonetheless .
He has however presented a package which he contends will stimulate the economy and create jobs .
Over half of the package $ 367 billion will come by removing the tax on dividends .
What do you think of the package will it stimulate the economy ?
In addition if the economy remains sluggish what are Bush 's chances for re - election ?
Yeah , it 'll stimulate the top ten percent of the wealthy in this country , but will do nothing for our economy .
Money must be put into the hands of the middle class and the poor for our economy to be stimulated .
The best way to accomplish that is to cut everybody 's taxes by ten percent effective January 1 , 2003 .
That 'll pump about a half trillion dollars into our economy . c.i.
Well , I thought it would be nice to see that title somewhere ... since I ca n't find it in Reality ....
It is wild to me how such an effective , strong , woman -- the closest advisor to the most powerful person in the world -- has garnered no more support , no accolades from women and blacks -- two groups who are always trying to find successful sisters or positive stories of black achievement .
I have noticed a distinct discrimination among women and blacks in whom they will ballyhoo , and whom they wo n't .
If any other woman in this country had soared to the heights Condi has reached , it would be Mardi Gras 24/7 ...
Clarence Thomas is unwelcomed among his own race .
The second black person to serve on the SCOTUS .
Even if he had a disfiguring pigment problem and a third leg , if he were the slightest bit liberal -- he 'd have statues and streets named after him already .
I heard a Georgia mayor on NPR today , and was heartened .
He was explaining to the ( of course , liberal ) quizzical reporter how he could be a Republican .
It was as if he had to apologize to the entire black community ...
I was proud that he told the reporter he felt racially stereotyped to be expected to be a Democrat .
He should n't be expected to be anything .
It is to the great , abiding shame of women and blacks to turn their backs on the great achievements of these people .
It is the New Racism ; by blacks against blacks .
The New Feminist Sexism . Appalling .
Some liberals do n't much cotton to " uppity " blacks like Powell , Thomas and Rice confronting racial discrimination and outright racism and leaving the plantation of dependency on white liberals and achieving the great things they are capable of .
Gotta ' keep ' em in their place , you know .
What does women or black have to do with it .
Clinton had a women secretary of state , and Rice does not represent blacks , so what is your beef ?
What amuses me about Rice is that she lived in the South during the Civil Rights movement , and that experience seems to have left her untouched .
Yet Bush mentioned that background as though she actually did anything beyond striving toward her own growth .
More power to her for her achievements .
But do n't be surprised if you 're not hearing wild applause from her community , because I 'm not sure she has one ...
Assuming she establishes a credible name for herself as Secretary of State , I am cautiously anticipating the GOP nominee in 2008 to be Condoleeza Rice .
And yes , I think she can be elected easily assuming that the GOP is allowed something close to a level playing field .
I think Colin Powell against Gore or Kerry in the last two elections would have won by a landslide .
Americans , especially Republican Americans , have largely left issues of racism and / or stereotypical prejudice and bigotry well behind them .
Any qualified person with charisma and a track record can compete with clout .
I keep hearing that inflation is under control .
And I suppose it is if one does not need to put food on the table , buy gasoline , heating oil , electricity and many of the necessities of life .
From your prospective do you find inflation to be a non - factor ?
Did n't seem to have much effect on the last couple of yachts I bought .
Now , I hear that high end housing ( 1 1/2 million + ) are also holding the line in some areas .
This whole economy seems to be based on the comfort level of the ones referred to by Dubya as his base .
Lock up all scumbags .
Lock 'm up .
Make 'm work .
Break up the gangs .
If you get caught with meth , got to jail ...
there is no unfortunate case .
You had dope its illegal , you knew it was illegal before you had the dope .
And to whomever spoke of the INNOCENCE in prison , Quit talking like that is the norm .
99.9 % of inmates deserve to be there .
I will take those odds in vegas any day .
Please pick Bloomberg to be your vicepresident .
Please read this if you do n't instantly see why ... http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1632736,00.html
He would ensure that moderates , libertarians , and technocrats sick of politics as usual would vote for you .
He is easily among the most competent politicians we have .
He researches and practices evidence based politics and thus virtually every policy he sought no matter how unpopular proved a success .
And he like you knows how to balance budgets without hurting the economy .
He can also pay for the election campaign .
I highly doubt that Bloomberg is going to switch parties .
He 's already an Independent ( switched from Republican ) .
But , offset Hillary 's " Northeastern Elite " and " inexperienced " negatives with Bloomberg 's " Northeastern Elite " and " inexperienced " negatives ? Not so much .
personally i look upon this conflict as the source of 90 % of western - muslim 's confrontation ,
the US needs and so supports Israel , Israel wants to stop attacks on its citizens and so strike on palestinian targets , which in turn results in more attacks on Israel , this increases the number of radical muslims too , which results in attacks against america around the world ( military targets , embassies , and citizens ) resulting in american foriegn policy like the war on Iraq and / or Afghanistan , and the circle continues , reactions to actions resulting in reactions , this circle having No beginning and no end
is not easy to solve , but if we try to and start by the issue at core ( palestinian - Israeli conflict ) the rest can be handled ,
i want to start a thread here , that simulates peace negotiations between two sides , palestinians ( me and who ever volunteers ) against Israeli side ( i suppose Volunteer wouldnot mind representing them and any one he chooses )
each side is allowed one posting per day , then after every two posts its discussed freely by all for two days , then each side makes a post , as the palestinian side is the one with most demands lets let them start ( if its ok by all ) ,
i need ur OK guys and Girls .
very true , the same people who said SADDAM violated UN resolutions , seem to forget , ISRAEL has been in violation of UN resolutions for decades .
Give up hell , tell them to come get it ?
That goes for Isreal too , if Egypt or Syria were anything worthwhile , Isreal would n't of got what they did .
To the victor goes the spoils .
Glad I 've never backed the UN .
Israel is Western , civilized , the progenitors of the first Christian community , and facing total annihilation every day of its life , thanks to being surrounded by psycopathic states .
THEREFORE ....... we must back it . : headbang :
So you think if Isreal stopped retaliating , the attacks would stop ?
No chance of that , they would chip at them untill they were extinct .
Max Blumenthal goes to the Young Republicans convention in DC , and asks why none of them - who strongly support the WoT and the War in Iraq - have bothered to sign up and serve in the armed forces .
Unsurprisingly , there were plenty of excuses banded about .
Republicans get mad when the ' Chickenhawk ' argument is brought up , and this is because it is damned effective .
They usually attempt to counter with some version of this line :
It is n't stupid , though .
There is a perceivable and significant differnce between those who discuss war , who think it is sometimes necessary , and who are willing to do what must be done for US safety ; and the War Cheerleaders .
The actively aggressive advocates of warfare as a solution to life 's problems .
Those are the Chickenhawks : the ones who continually advocate the solving of our national Foreign policy problems using armed force .
The ones who suggest that the US is so strong , we can go it alone if we have to and we should n't be held back from attacking other countries by little things like , say , international conventions .
They advocate using maximum force to win ; their problem with the war in Iraq is that we are n't killing enough people over there , innocents included .
These people , who cheer on the deaths of others , who think that force is the best way to get what we want - but do n't sign up to serve themselves - are Chickenhawks .
They are too cowardly to put their ass on the line , but continually advocate that others do so .
This topic is right on the money .
These leeches and vultures are the ones getting rich off of the nation 's blood .
They stand safely back , saying , " Let 's you and them fight .
Me ? I 'll cheer you on , while me and my friends get rich off your efforts . "
There was a time when I strongly supported the invasion of Iraq , and it had nothing to do with presenting the good people of Iraq with a democratic form of government .
Oh , I also spent 5 years in the US Army , from a time when most of us had heard of Indochina , through the period when just everybody could name each country in the region .
So , I 'm an oddball . S'okay .
Yes , I would imagiane that Patrick Daniel Tillman most likely did n't need the $ when he enlisted but it is curious why Bush rendered the investigation of his death as a secret of national security .
The Chinese are going to stab us in the back . if we do n't turn away from Iraq and Afghanistan to rebuild / recover our strength . Where they 're financially and militarily , bleeding us to death .
Fine , threaten to sell Aegis equipped ships to Taiwan if they do so .
If China were to do that , they would be cutting their own throats .
The LAST thing that China wants is a weak dollar because that would completely wipe out any chance of a trade surplus from their number one trading partner ... the U.S.
A weak dollar means lots and lots of closed down factories in China because the Americans ca n't afford their widgets and doohickies .
They will threaten , they will try to influence , but they wo n't ' drop the bomb ' unless they have a guarantee of some other country willing to buy several hundred billion dollars worth of junk a year .
What do you think the consequences would be ?
Do you think the Shrub could pull it off ?
If not , why ?
His approval rating can not sink , so , what 's the risk .
After all , he 's the Decider , and Congress holds his trousers while he skinny dips .
Does America want us to lose this war and cut and run as Reid and Pelosi have impose upon our president ?
Does America want us to have to fight our way back in in six month or a year with a death toll in multiples of thousands over a radically less period of time ?
Also if we pull out of Iraq and go into Darfur what will be the justification for joining that war , WMD ?
Reid and Pelosi telling the government not to fight America 's war is like congress and the senate telling the government not to fight racism and the KKK a few decades back .
These cowardly democrats are bargaining that Americans will be stupid and not realize the deeper war that will have to be re - fought in only a few short years .
Iran and Russia will be the next war along with Chavez if we do not create a successful democracy in Iraq .
The power vacuum will in Iraq pull Iran and Russia and possibly the whole middle east and maybe even China into an allied front against America .
This my friends is Armageddon .
Reid and Pelosi have been told this I am sure but they simply do n't care .
Winning elections trumps all other concerns ...
Do we really want these people setting public policy ?
Why not leave and let the Iraqis fight the war ?
Answer : If the Most powerful army is already struggling in this war what will it be like when we pull out and come back in six months to a year ?
Reid and Pelosi stop trying to shove your partisan politics at our president over the generals " sound " military policies .
Listening to your bribe bibber Murtha instead of our generals ...
Seven friggin ' years of this crap is ENOUGH !!!
If we pull out now the disaster will be on YOUR heads just in time for election ...
The blood of freedom is at stake and the very people who claim to value it are now our own worst enemies .
The new democratic KKK selling our freedom and dignity simply for power .
Does America look to geniuses such as yourself for analysis ?
. Now I know you are just kidding , that attitude is just whacky otherwise .
There are tons of examples in history of ill advised " proactive " wars , and most of these were eventually lost by the aggressors
Also , rex , try to be civilized and dont resort to childish name calling .
Its usually a sign of an inability to craft an argument solely based upon the issues at hand .
Just because you feel passionately about this doesnt automatically mean that others will embrace your opinions .
OH YEH , AND , if you call me a coward again , Ill come up there to Jonesport , hunt you down , and buy you a drink first .
I 'm thinking Farmerman means what he says .
The day it becomes truly cowardly of one to suggest an end to mindless mayhem is the day I want to float off this planet .
Edgar , you know its a cynical attempt at " spin " by the rapidly sinking SS Bush .
His " handlers " are trying to cover ytracks and leave a legacy that is goona leve his presidency up there with Harding or Buchanan .
( oy , theres a comparison , Buchanan , I believe started the first of the ' proactive wars " against the Mormons ) ,
People like you have done more to screw this country up than " the democrats " could ever have hoped to do .
You repeatedly voted for and supported a president and an administration who was clearly and obviously incompetent and ideologically extreme .
This was evident from campaign through the early years of governance .
You think that America means red , white , and blue and war and think nothing of shredding the constitution on the way to more blood and glory .
And you dare to presume that you are somehow the " real Americans " and the rest of us , those of us who actually know what the Constitution says and know what this ignoramus is trying to do to it , are somehow going to destroy " your " country .
You wave your flag and trust an ignorant incompetent who ca n't even run this country to somehow rebuild another , one that he did n't even begin to understand and had never been to .
You trust an idiot .
You think the answer to incompetence and mismanagement is faith .
You and your brethren , the Bush die - hards , have sent this country in a death spiral .
And sadly , the only people we can have any hope of pulling us out are the " other party " .
A party that already was waning in respect due to corruption and its willingness to take some fundamental social justice concepts too far is now supported by a majority of the public , and the beloved party of small government and individual liberties is now a hulking rusty heap of corruption , scandal , incompetence , special interests , big government , and domestic spying .
maybe I am , and maybe I 'm saying that you 're an idiot .
Hard to say exactly . : wink :
You mean SCUT FARKAS and his sidekick " toady " was Grover Dill , who was actually beaten up by Delbert Bumpus .
I need to set these things correct so that the record will be clear testimonyat Rex 's sanity hearing .
I am a conservative , and you are an idiot .
You said ..
Most Christions I know will not bow to another God , no matter who that God is .
Thats why so many Christians were killed by the ancient Romans , they refused to bow down .
Also , to use an old cliche ... " I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees "
I was reading in the paper today about all the laws under consideration that would make it harder for Americans to vote when I suddenly flashed on all the purple fingered Iraqi voters that were so celebrated in our press only a few short years ago .
I think I must be missing something because I 'm really confused by this .
Why would any state do anything that would make it harder for it 's citizens to vote ?
Please can someone explain this to me ?
That 's pretty easy .
Conseratives figure ( and probably with justification ) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdles which might be thrown in their way .
They rely on older citizens and more affluent citizens .
Anything which makes voting more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voters going to the polls to vote for Democrats .
I do n't have a problem with the first two - provided that they make available photo IDs at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instructions and make it easy to obtain ( in other words - there are many locations to obtain and enough hours that are varied enough to get these ids ) .
I support having IDs to limit voter fraud , but you can not make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an ID .
I mean if you make the extra effort to go out and vote - it should n't be much more a burden to get an ID .
The Democrats must return to their progressive program , and must spend the resources necessary to remind the people that the GOP , the right wing , the Tea Party are just plain wrong on the issues .
Hopefully the Massachusetts loss has made Obama go back on the progressive track .
What is interesting about the 2 party system is the people never actually vote FOR a party .
They always vote AGAINST THE OTHER ONE .
The net result is the people are misrepresented 100 % of the time - but amazingly they are so dumb they ca n't figure it out .
We asked you : To save money , should local governments use nonviolent inmates for physical labor ?
That was the question in the other day 's opinion section of my my local newspaper .
YES : 92.6 % NO : 7.4 %
So my qestion is this , should gov't turn to slaves to save money ?
@David cv , Depending on country it is already done .
Hard labour , chaingangs , prison farms Voluntary work while incarcerated gets minimal pay etc
The option as voluntary will at least not require quotas and enforcement through violent means ( beatings ) or witholding of priveledges like food , bedding ( yes bedding ) or outdoor sunlight and isolation . ( legislativ brutality encouragement )
The question is what kind of work is beneficial in a crime and punishment related way .
Some experiements are already implemented in disaster relief bushfires / floods , comunity work as replacement for incarceration . ( Anti social behaviour treatment )
It really depends on the moral standards of the Nation in question .
Forced labour in Europe compared to Africa or America is implemented differently
Have'nt goverments / corporations turned their populus trough a monetary reward / tax system into working slaves anyway ?
what 's your thoughts on this ?
i mean , the guy is 88 years old .
Is it really necessary after all these years ?
he 's been here since 1955 and never did a thing to any one .
being a nazi was what was expected of germans back then .
you and i , had we lived there during that time , would probably have been in the same boat .
The head of the OSI is named Rosenbaum , what do you expect ?
While I disagree with you that we 'd all be Nazis , it was over 60 years ago , and the man has obviously reformed .
Expelling him was a political move to strengthen the Zionist stance through a reminder of the holocaust , and serve as a talking point for the anti - Ahmadinejad crowd .
So I was discussing that new tv show on ABC , Commander in Chief , with my grandfather .
He made a comment that was interesting , he said , " That show is just the liberal media trying to get us used to the idea of a woman president for when Hillary runs . "
Now , my grandfather is one of those old , cynical guys that thinks that every sports game that does n't go his way is fixed , and is a tad racest , however , I found the statement intrigueing and made me wonder .
What are your guys ' opinions ?
I 've definitely heard that argument before , and I refuse to watch the dang show .
Ok so I live in MI and maryjane was just legalized in our state .
Well all know why a state would legalize it , but do you really think that it can help somebody ? If so why ?
Think of any other drugs that you feel may help someone .
Think of this . When I was doing crystal , I was in school .
I never missed a day of school .
When I went to my classes tweaking , I paid more attention to what was going on in class .
I went home did ALL of my homework .
I remember lookin at one of my report cards before I started using and my grades were either all d 's or d 's and f 's .
Then I looked at a report card that I got that had ALL a 's on it .
I was soo high on crystal that semester that I do not even remember most what happened at school or at home .
So I ask do you think drugs can be good for some people ?
I know that no matter what no drug is good for anyone .
This does n't mean that I would go back and change things if I could , because I really do not want to .
I am just wondering how other people feel about this .
@secondchance , I think that drugs can have positives but I think that they 'll rarely come without negatives and whether or not it 's a net positive is hard for anyone to tell , most of all the user .
@secondchance , it is possible to self medicate to a positive outcome . responsible use is required .
For instance a couple of generations of artists have widely used drugs , convinced that the change in consciousness is of great help to their work .
We moderns have no doubt but that it is a good idea to drug people up on Ritalin and anti anxiety drugs and antidepressants , this highly drugged society has no basis to complain about weed and coke .
Meth though messes people up big time , so I do n't see a lot of upside to that .
Yes , and I 'm one of them .
My life would be impoverished without my daily glass of wine .
I quite enjoyed the few joints I have tried .
And sometime , when I 'm in a better general mood than I am right now , I 'd like to try LSD or one of its relatives , maybe magic mushrooms .
To me , consuming drugs is a matter of moderation , not abstinence .
My wife has Constant ringing in her ears : noise , a " whooshing " as she describes .
Any ideas ? THANKS
@RobC , That 's tinnitus .
She should see an otorhinolaryngologist ( ear specialist ; ear , nose and throat specialist ) as , if this is recent , there may be things they can do .
I just watched the most fascinating , inspiring , and yet heartbreaking documentary : The Half Ton Man .
Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in the world today .
Is there a fat gene ?
Science seems to think there is .
Many people feel hungry every minute they are awake and fight the fact they know they are literally killing themselves with every bite they take .
One man in the documentary lost 706 pounds !
Yet , when he reached 198 pounds he celebrated by having a hot dog , which turned into two , three , etc.
He now is morbidly obese again and is n't ready to go back into rehab at a center that has great success in helping these people .
When I was younger I could eat virtually anything and not gain weight .
I 'm almost 52 and it 's not quite that easy for me to keep my weight to what is comfortable for me .
I am able to do it , but watching this video scared me . One woman in the video was actually eight feet wide when she got help .
I have seen shows on TV where two year old children weigh nearly 200 pounds all because their parents want to appease the child and stop their fussing .
Does anyone out there have a big problem with their weight ?
How do you combat it ?
Is food an addiction ?
Is over - eating a disease like drug addiction or alcoholism ?
Now , THAT 'S a link ! LOL
I think the problem and cure is psychological . They should spend more time on the psycology of it coupled with the surgery .
Oh , now there getting into that part .
I watched that documentary on Patrick Deuel a while back .... too bad he 's gained some weight back .
But there 's always hope he 'll get back on track .
Besides the obvious medical issues with him , I was disturbed by the co - dependant relationship with his wife .
At his worst , he weighed 1,072 pounds .
He was unable to even roll over in bed , let alone get to the refrigerator or supermarket ....
he could n't even get to a phone or a computer to order food if you put it 10 feet away from him .
So .... who was feeding his all that crap ?
Who was bringing it to him ?
She feels she 's showing love by bringing him to deaths door because he asked for ( or begged or ranted ) for food .
And not just food .... garbage .
I understand love for your spouse , but theirs is not a healthy relationship .
Also , in the video , after he had gotten under 500 pounds , Patrick said " I avoid foods with a lot of fat and sodium " .... as he was snacking on individual size bags on salted nuts and potato chips .
In the scene before that ( after his gastic bypass and much weight loss ) , the wife brought him dinner .... Kentucky Fried Chicken .
" Oh " , she said , " Here 's your protein " , as she waved an extra crispy drumstick at him .
My husband loves egg sald .
When I make it , I through out 4 out of the 12 yolks , and mix in a pound of tofu .... he never knows the difference .
( BTW , he 's very thin , but has a heart condition ) .
Wifey could maybe take some lessons from me .
Doctors have told me I have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and must have surgery or my shoulder will freeze .
Looking for information from anyone who has had it or with someone recuperating .
I have heard the recovery is brutally painful .
Any tips , suggestions , etc. , about what to expect during first few days , how to manage , sleep , any info .
I had it done three years ago at Johns Hopkins .
I had suffered low grade " bursitis " in one shoulder for many years ( probably a worn rotator cuff ) , until one day while working out I got a real , full tear .
Lots of serious pain with some movements or any strenuous exertion .
My surgery was successful , but it took me several months to regain my range of motion in the shoulder .
I learned that the post op therapy is probably more critical than the surgery itself .
I was determined to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine , so I in effect took charge of the rehab program and made it clear to the therapist the Orthopedic Surgeon that I would n't accept less .
In retrospect I believe this was the critical thing , in that the Docs . and the therapists take their cues from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery , they will let you go .
If you are determined to go on , they will help .
I have full use of the shoulder and no more pain .
I would do it again .
I hope this is helpful and wish you good luck !
I 'm under erratic , severe stress in my personal life and my colorful , efficient adrenalin glands are playing merry hell with my blood pressure .
I 'm hoping to avoid drugs by losing weight and learning serenity , but meanwhile I 'm supposed to monitor my blood pressure at home .
Once upon a time I had a jim - dandy wrist unit that worked perfectly .
Then after 7 years of faithful service , it up and died .
Now the wrist units at the local drugstores come with a read - outbox that is too wide for my 5 1/2 inch wrist .
I 've also tried the wrap - the - upper arm monitors .
These only work about 20 % of the time and dealing with them sends my blood pressure up to new heights .
Also , because of a lumpectomy I can only use my left arm for B.P. readings .
I 'm left handed , but am making progress in non - dominent - hand dexterity .
Can anyone recommend a no - hassle , Luddite - friendly home blood pressure monitor that will work around bird bones ?
Noddy , from your post I assume you have not checked on the models currently on the market .
Most companies have fully automatic models that do n't require adjusting it to your arm with every use .
You adjust it once to fit your arm ( You can do this with it off your arm ; it might take two tries ) and that 's that .
Slip it on your arm . Press a button and in less than a minute read your B.P. and heart rate .
I 've had an Omron for three years and have never had a problem .
I think it cost in the vicinity of $ 50 - $ 60 .
You can get them a bit cheaper if you are willing to pump it up yourself .
The semi - automatic that I have does the pumping for you .
As I sit here foggy headed and lets face it with most of the symptoms of hypoglycemia I thought I should do something about it .
Im trying to start to eat healthily , slowly but surely , which means cutting out processed foods and eating more natural things .
A good start to begin with but not necessarily dealing with hypoglycemia .
It says give up things like caffiene , tobacco , things I dont consume anyway , it says give up wheat , which is bread , which I tend to eat alot of .
I assume we all do , it kind of houses all the other ingredients we need like in sandwiches or wraps , pizza .
Basically does anybody have any advice on what to eat or recomend a good book ?
Search out a glycemia index , and determine something both edible and low on the list .
Add that to your diet , to avoid getting into hypoglycemia .
If it happens anyway , skim ( non fat ) milk will raise the blood sugar about as fast as anything .
Indulge in a light bedtime snack , again , something fairly low on the list .
Do n't overdo it , though .
i have not yet been diagnosed but i am beginning to suspect hypoglycemia / low blood sugar .
lately i have been very confused , have anxiety , dizziness , fatigued , weak , depressed , and generally low .
i know i need to gain more weight - i lost about 20 pounds suddenly about 6 months ago and have n't been able to gain it back .
how does a doctor diagnose someone with this ?
what tests should i have them run ?
I have been reading about FluMist , the new flu vaccine that is administered intranasally .
One thing that I noticed , is that it is marketed as suitable for people ages 5-49 .
I have not seen any material as to why the 50 + population is unsuitable for this vaccine .
Anybody know why ?
Well , according to that FDA link children between 5 and 17 are the most likely to actually get the flu itself and it looks like that was the intended target age group for the development of FluMist .
They note that it is 87 % effective in preventing people in that range from getting the flu at all but people in the 18-49 range only had lessened symptoms .
It seems the older the patient the less effective the drug .
It is inconceivable that you take a multivitamin in good faith and it wrecks havoc on your health in such a profound way but that is the case .
I " was " taking a Centrum multivitamin once a day as suggested on the back label and I was waking up with dry mouth so sever I could not even swallow .
My skin was getting scaly , my eyes burning and my feet were so dry they begin to develop calluses and crack .
I stopped my vitamin and it is now gone .
WHAT IS UP CENTRUM ?
It is not just Centrum but any type of multivitamin causes this .
If you search the internet for " dry mouth and multivitamin " you get this idiot named " Jade M " on Google answers that replies that it is " not likely " that a multivitamin is causing this dryness of nearly every cell in the body .
Sorry to say Jade M whoever you are but you are WRONG ...
If you do n't know what you are talking about you should n't be doling out incorrect information in an online medical forum .
My sister is a nurse at a veterans hospital and she complained to her doctor that she was getting dry mouth .
He told her that it was her multivitamin and she cut down her intake of the multivitamin and her dry mouth left completely .
A friend of mine who takes many medications for his heart just came up to me and told me he was getting terrible dry mouth at night and reduced his multivitamin to only a few times a week and now no more dry mouth .
In other words if you follow the directions on the back label of your vitamins they will start slowly killing you .
Do n't expect Paul G. Donohue M. D. to help you either .
He basically dismisses this elderly persons claim then tries to get her to take corrective medications .
How typical ...
I get dry mouth too plus my skin gets dry and scaly and when I stop my multivitamin it immediately goes away .
Now this is four completely unrelated people all coming to the exact same conclusion .
Not only can we not trust the general consensus on the internet but we can not trust people who have PHD credentials giving their advice online .
What do we have to dry up and die before we finally figure out what ails us ?
When my sister told this to me I did not really give it much thought .
Then I permanently lost 10 % of my eyesight due to dry eyes .
Then my mouth chronically became dry , skin kept piling up on my feet that I could n't sand it off fast enough to keep up with it , the skin on my hands became scaly and my lips kept cracking and my tongue felt like it had pins and needles poking into it .
I stop the multivitamin and my mouth symptoms are gone , sadly my eyesight is still damaged .
I should have just listened to my sister rather than err , Jade M.
My doctor was even prescribing fish oil supplements to correct the dry skin problem which could not even put a dent in the problems being caused by my multivitamin .
I do n't consume a lot of salt in my diet and I am on no other medications or drugs whatsoever .
If you are experiencing dry mouth and take a multivitamin stop the vitamin immediately before you ruin your health irreversibly .
Take it only a few times a week , if that , and you will realize the vitamins cause this .
I was also told by a pharmacist that other than the antioxidants , a person gets what they need from their diet of most minerals and do not require a multivitamin at all .
So a strictly antioxidant formula is all that is required minus the multivitamin minerals .
Please weigh in on this , sorry I am upset about this but I am also troubled now by internet advice that is clearly WRONG about this issue and no telling how many others .
Tinnitus , vision loss , global cellular degeneration , moisture loss , and even constipation are all caused by general use of multivitamins .
Also if you are feeding your children multivitamins you should be highly cautious of this too .
Even children should only be given a multivitamin a few times a week and not every day .
They should be explained the dangers of regular use of vitamins ( in other words following the prescribed dosage ) .
Take it from me who has experienced this first hand , my sister who is a nurse , my friend taking many meds whose dry mouth stopped the very day he cut down on his multivitamin and L.F who was incorrectly advised by , err , Donehue .
It is a sad commentary that people have to collectively learn this on their own and that doctors , health specialists and the internet are so out of the loop .
Consider that vitamin waters and health food drinks on top of a multivitamin only compound this problem .
I forget what my sister said was causing this , I seem to recall zinc , but I may be wrong about that .
I have to ask her again .
Consider if it is visibly destroying your skin it is also destroying your major organs too .
Please comment and offer any further advice on this subject .
I just started on a new kind of multivitamin and my body 's been all kinds of crazy .
I used to just take specific vitamins but that got expensive and elaborate and I was missing some things so I switched to a multi .
The multi has calcium and I know from previous experience that calcium tears my stomach up .
I 'm getting older and I know that I need some calcium though .
I do n't have dry mouth but I agree that multivitamins can have unintended consequences .
I have been taking high potency multivitamins for almost twenty years .
I have not know any side effects .
One thing , though is to not have certain foods too close to the time of the taking , because certain ones can interact .
For instance , I am taking something now that advises to not take regular vitamin C for an hour on either side of taking that product .
It suggests discontinuing the 12 hour release of Vitamin C for as long as that product is being used .
I have to constantly make such comparisons to make sure it all works .
I am on very high dose vitamin C , besides my green multiple , that is very concentrated compared top wimpy Centrum .
I never had dry mouth until this high dose of C , so I am assuming it is the C.
I use it as an antihistamine to control my IBS .
I have overactive mast cells that start pulling water into my gut when i run out of C and Magnesium ( this I think was caused by taking a round of vaccines in 2003 , and the studies I found online confirm that mercury in the adjuvants often do cause increased histamine production ) .
So I am on 4000-6000mg of C 4X daily and 400-600 mg Magnesium 4 x Daily .
This is a lot , but I have learned it does control my bowels .
The normal person would get colon blow from these doses , and it firms me up to normal .
This is ultimately an adrenal issue , as the adrenals are throwing out huge amounts of electrolytes and I am sure other stuff , so until I realized this I was in constant loose bowels losing my nutrients .
But it HAS caused dry mouth .
I do n't think it is as bad as some I have read here .
There are some archaelogists who believe that two sites in Syria could be the world 's earliest cities .
Tell Brak and Tell Hamoukar in the NE of Syria may have existed back in 3700BC .
Seems plausible .
Damascus is generally considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world .
It 's mentioned by name in Genesis as a place where Abraham stopped on his way to Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees ( in modern - day Iraq ) .
According to this , American citizens can now be arrested and detained indefinitely without trial .
Does that mean that anyone can be taken and put into a hole forever without justification ?
If so , I think it 's scary .
But who decides that the person was actually a member of or working for Al Qaeda ?
What court can review that decision ?
Well , the verdict just came in .
Guilty of involuntary manslaughter .
The judge would not let him be released until sentencing either .
The judge said his behavior was wreckless and the community could be in harm 's way . ( Not his exact words ) .
I am glad he is losing his license .
No matter what , he never should have given Michael Jackson that propofol .
The man practiced here for many years .
The local TV news is running nothing but outrage over the conviction .
Not one word in favor of it .
The local ABC channel featured a legal expert who derided the trial , calling it a travesty , making doctors afraid to treat patients and so forth .
He seems to think a " proper " court would have let Murray go free .
An increasing proportion of US children are so severely obese as to be at immediate risk for life - threatening complications including type 2 diabetes .
Some will become candidates for treatment at newly established pediatric surgical weight loss programs throughout the country .
As an alternative approach , involvement of state protective services might be considered , including placement into foster care in carefully selected situations .
Ultimately , government can reduce the need for such interventions through investments in the social infrastructure and policies to improve diet and promote physical activity among children .
Severe obesity in children -- is that a form of child abuse ?
Should the state step in and save these kids from their parents ?
David ... you 're so not looking at the big picture .
If this current trend continues , a whole generation or two will be lost .
Considering that we are globally competing against India and China who so far DO N'T suffer this epidemic , we will fall farther behind in almost every aspect .
These next generations will become a major burden on our health care system .
Prevention is needed now not later when it will most likely NOT work .
Cheaper to fix it now then to let it cripple the entire economy at a later date .
I live in CA and I signed an affiliation agreement 12/09 which states that I was to pay a monthly fee to the owners .
The owners said " NOT " to pay until my business had picked up .
Although my business is struggling , I have tried several times to start paying this fee .
Each time the owners said " NO " do n't worry about .
We have now parted ways , for both personal and professional reasons , and now they are taking me to small claims court for the affiliation fee they said I did n't have to pay plus their legal fees ( I am being bullied ) .
Has anyone dealt with a situation like this ?
I thought a verbal agreement would override a written agreement , but is that hard to prove ?
I mean obviously the proof is that they are suing me for back fees that I have not been paying because business has been slow .
Please , help or share your story .
It sounds like there is more than what you have posted .
Did you break a lease or agreement with them ?
Leave early ?
It sounds like they were waiving certain fees , with the understanding that you were going to stay for the long haul .
If you left early , then they now want all their fees .
A written agreement trumps a verbal agreement .
A written agreement is hard proof .
Without that it 's your word against their word .
You should have put the money is escrow if you felt uncomfortable with the arrangement .
My newspaper has an article today on animal hoarders , listing some signifigant recent cases :
One woman lived on an old school bus with 117 dogs , 4 cats and 2 chickens .
One man had 500 dogs .
Another had 80 cats .
Two weeks ago , animal services confiscated 39 cats living with a man in a van .
Most hoarders live in unimaginable filth .
( I did n't want to post the photos because they are really gross . )
Most of these people are charged with animal abuse and neglect and they are fined and jailed .
Do you think these people are criminals ?
i watched animal planet ( way too late at night this weekend ) and saw a florida animal cops .
They busted a hoarder with 82 dogs and confiscated 78 of them ( i think legally in fla you can have 4 ) .
The dogs were in such bad shape , some could n't walk because their nails were so long , most were flea infested and had been sleeping in their own feces .
there were two sets of puppies in the house and as they panned around the house , it appeared that there were at least two other sets of puppies in the making .
the woman was not prosecuted as long as she was willing to give up the amount needed to take her back to the legal limit .
and they checked up on her after that .
apparently the media ran a story about it and over 40 dogs were adopted the first day they were available .
i go for mentally ill as well , but like freeduck said , sometimes the only way to get them treatment is to prosecute .
They just told this woman they would keep checking up on her ( randomly so she could n't hide pets like she was when they were rounding them up ) and as long as she had only 4 , she was fine .
that seems reasonable to me since no dogs were dead , no dogs were starving , they just needed more attention .
it was a much better story than the dog chained to a tree for 3 weeks in florida heat that finally succumbed ... made me cry .
now those people should be tied to a tree with no food and water and see how they do ...
We had our own local " cat lady " who made the newspaper headlines a couple of decades ago .
She lived in a filthy , almost uninhabitable house surrounded by cats , cats , cats .
Many people tried to help her , but she made it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of having her home condemned .
And that 's what eventually happened .
Her house was declared a public nuisance and the city tore it down .
I 'm pretty sure this old lady had more than just a few screws loose .
I saw her many years ago at a local supermarket .
She was wearing a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hairs sticking out .
She was slumped against a wall and the store personnel had called an ambulance .
It was a pathetic sight .
I think it is a kind of depression myself , where one lets go of a lot of effort to keep up with daily life except to ' care ' for animals , and then is overwhelmed but sees no way out of it - except that they do , I gather , start again .
A kind of compulsion .
Not that I do n't want them stopped .
Is this a kind of ocd ? a pre - alzheimers ?
There is something to be said for humane institutional care , and I am not talking about the dogs .
Tricky subject , on which I can see several sides .
Please - this is NOT a thread about the case , as such , I find those threads concerning - BUT about some of the differences between the American , and some other countries ' practices - and their effect .
For instance : i ) In Australia , and , I believe , Great Britain at the very least , the name of a juvenile involved in a criminal matter is not revealed , whether they be alleged victim , or alleged perpetrator , except in very special circumstances
( eg they have been kidnapped , and police seek public help to find them - or they have been murdered - or if they are alleged to have committed a very serious crime and are being tried as adults , or if it is in some way in the public interest . )
To these non - US eyes , it is very shocking to see the name and photograph of the young man alleged to have been abused by Jackson splashed all over the media -
here , juveniles are protected to the point that , on the few occasions I have accompanied a minor who was raped or sexually abused to court , while she / he gave testimony - if the offender ( these were cases where , oddly , a conviction was obtained , so I do not say " alleged " offender ) was also a minor , it was a big deal to be allowed in to be a support person for the victim , because I would hear the name of the offender .
What do people think of the US practice ?
What is the reason for it ?
Which would you prefer ?
What do you think is the impact on young people so identified ?
ii ) The media circus .
Here , both defence and prosecution are very limited as to what they can say about a case that is before the courts . The matter is considered sub judice .
Occasionally , with high profile cases , the police will " leak " things - and / or the media will attempt , within the letter of the law , to try a case in the media ( the Lindy Chamberlain case was a terrible example of both these occurrences ) -
but the organised propaganda campaigns that I think I detect in the US are not generally present .
Full details are generally releasable only after the trial .
Again , the spectacle is very shocking to these non - US eyes .
I presume it is allowed because of an interpretation of free speech ?
Do people think it aids justice ? That it is societally positive ? What do you think ?
iii ) This is unrelated - but , do people think this is going to be another black v white case , and do you think that high profile non - Caucasian people still - despite their wealth and power - are unfairly treated in the US justice system ?
I would think that , similarly to here , that poorer and obscure people of colour would tend to be - but I am interested in views re people who have achievedfame and fortune .
Judging the US legal system based on what goes on in , say , the Jackson case is probably a bad idea .
I 've served on jury duty several times and came away highly impressed with how seriously everybody took their various responsibilities .
A case like Jackson 's , alas , or the Kobe Bryant case betray many standards .
The media have some role in this , as do glory - hounding attorneys on both sides .
I 'm sure , for example , that a minor 's name should never be publicized in a case like this .
I 'm trying to pay as little attention to this case as possible , because I think it 's more a freak show than anything else .
Please do n't judge our system on the basis of the Jackson trial !
We have very strict publication bans around identity of abused minors in Canada .
The person charged often can not be identified , as their name , and the details of the relationship to the child , would mean the child could possibly be identified .
Sleeping next to the elephant means we 've probably become a bit jaded to the circus . But the laws are much tighter here .
I would be extraordinarily happy not to make such a judgment , D'Artagnan !!!! But - it is ALLOWED to happen !
Would the name of the child , for instance , normally be suppressed ?
How often do cases become media circuses ?
I guess what I am getting at is the different LAWS on such matters ...
Interesting to have such differences in the systems of countries that grew so similarly , ehBeth .
We seem much more like you guys - but , I suppose , the US invented its laws after a revolution - we inherited them after centuries of slow evolution with no cataclysm , and made changes slowly .
I think but I 'm not completely sure if you can print any name of a sexual abuse victim in Canada without the express permission of the victim .
You can not print the name of any minor whether the victim or perpetrator of any crime , except in very special / rare circumstances where a minor is at large and a suspected danger to the community or themselves .
A court order is needed in these cases and once the minor is apprehended the name and or picture must not be printed again , ever .
News outlets are rarely allowed to print anything specific in these cases as well .
In cases of family abuse the names are rarely printed , if ever , in order to protect the victim .
I had no idea the victim in the Jackson cases was publicized .
I have seen pictures of his previous victim which I though was pretty appalling but generally the faces have been smudged out .
What I hope will happen here is that people will come along to present the case FOR allowing the names to be made public , because it is incomprehensible to me -
but there MUST be reasons for the US system to be the way it is on these matters .
It is n't as though people in the US are not interested in and critical of their own system - gotta be a reason ...
I think they are getting ready to bring the first miner up .
Over 2,000 feet up , in a little tube , through a little tunnel .
On CNN I saw a picture they showed of the faces of the miners , and I saw at least a couple guys that look way too big to fit in that thing .
I guess they 'll be sucking in their guts .
Wow , 69 days .
That 's like a full season of Big Brother .
I guess the whole rescue is supposed to take about two days , if their estimates are correct and nothing goes wrong .
And the whole thing will be watched live all over the world .
Here 's a place where there are some livestreams if you want to check it out .
Americans could learn a lot from the Chilean people as the 33 miners are rescued .
They came together to support and save the miners ' lives .
So much better than the political party fighting going on over the coming elections in the U.S.
I have a question .
The last man , one of the rescuers , must be able to lock the rescue tube 's door correctly from the inside ?
I can understand how he could hook up the oxygen pack and other devises , but I ca n't figure out how he can lock the door so it does n't come loose if no one is there to do it from the outside .
he will have to hold it shut with a handle or maybe a bungee cord held on the inside .
Good question .
Looks like these guys are gonna get out in time to do their Christmas Shopping
I am sorry ; but I thought Chili was part of America ...
One of them at least ...
They come in two 's you know ... Inner Mongolia , and outer Mongolia ... That sort of thing ...
In any event , I do not know the answer to your question ...
It would seem that for most doors , there is a handle on the inside and the outside ...
Just like Hammers have claws so you can go both ways with a nail ...
Speaking from experience , it is damned difficult some times not having reverse on a motor cycle ...
You ca n't stop riding without thinking about riding later ...
Here I am , and how do I get out ..
I 'm watching on the telly yet another shooter ( Orlando Fla ) news says 8 victims taken to hospital .
You know what David is going to tell you in a few minutes : if the others had guns to protect themselves , they all would be dead by now .
That 's how gun logic works , my dear dys .
Guess all the gun crazy psychotics are flipping out of the woodwork .
yeah , and then I 'm a gun owner .
And your " " " " enlightened " " " " solution is ?
my " enlightened " solution is for everyone to determine who might become a potential shooter and kill them before they are able to harm anyone .
Does my sarcasm equate adequately to yours ?
I 'm talking specifically about the showing of the contents of the package that he sent to NBC .
I realize that this stuff will probably come out anyway , and that the public really REALLY wants to see what was in that package , but is n't it also in a way glorifying / validating the guy 's actions and giving him exactly what he wanted ?
For instance , the image of him pointing a gun at the camera is on just about every news site I see online , and the video clips of his rantings are starting to show up everywhere as well . And his writing .
I realize how fascinating it is to try to get inside this nutball 's head , but is there any way to put the news out there about him without giving him rock star status ?
Is it even possible ?
I wonder how long until this stuff shows up on murderauction.com or one of those other disgusting sites .
I think there can be details ( what happened when , who tried to do what , etc. ) without spreading his own propaganda . Because that 's what it is .
He stage - managed this -- he wanted the badass stuff out there , he wanted that lasting image .
Just show a small picture of who he was , the original one was fine .
The rest is unnecessary , and articles BBB and nimh have linked to argue convincingly that the propaganda is downright dangerous .
The American public has reached the point in our culture , that the news that gets the most coverage is the news that plays to the lowest common denominator amongst us .
Think about it . For weeks , there was Pamela Anderson and the baby . Then it was Don Imus . Now all we hear about is that murderous nutjob who acted on his sickest delusions .
It is like the newspapers and TV want to beat out the supermarket rags . Ugh !
I 've been enjoying the NYTimes blog , primarily by Michael Kimmelman , who I 'm used to reading when he writes about art .
But he 's joined by several other good writers who are apparently hanging around the US Open typing away as they feel like it .
I like all the different viewpoints .
Have always like Vecsey 's writing , but ca n't read him in the paper lately because he 's now in the Times Select group that you have to pay for to get access to , even on the day of the article .
My favorite writer on the blog is Kimmelman , he seems to have my eyes , if I had his .
I 'm enjoying the play by play , as it were , so much that I want to see if I can go back and read the blog on the World Cup .
Probably not , as so much time has passed .
Anybody on a2k following this ?
Going to the matches ?
I do follow international tennis -- one of the first things I want to glance over on the morning newspaper .
Not going to the matches , though ?
Well , so are you following the US open ( http://www.usopen.org/ ) ?
Who are your fave players ?
Yeah , she sure was a tennis prodigy .
She 's always lacked the killer serve that is a key to today 's power game , though .
If she did n't have it in her heyday , she 's not going to have it now in the twilight of her career .
Hey , hope your day is going well !
I have a question for anyone who feels that want to answer .
I have been watching a bit of ' Rhythmic Gymnastics ' on YouTube ... I just find it amazing ... it 's very cool .
I do n't have children , but when I get to that stage , I 'd love a daughter of mine to take part in this really cool sport .
My question though is , is it true or just a myth that while all this crazy flexibility at a young age is nice , at old age they will be in pain and not able to move at all ?
If it is true , I 'd prefer not to have any part in it , but if it 's not true , it would be great to know .
Can anyone help ?
I 'm no expert , but Nadia Comenechi , the famous Romanian gymnast , has no health problems from her gymnastics days though her former gymnast husband is wracked with arthritis .
Thanks for you quick reply .
Could it be that different people react to it in different ways ?
Maybe you just enjoy it while you do , and if you find it painful afterwards ... bad luck , if not ... GREAT !
Has anyone else got any other thoughts ?
I 'm not familiar with rhythmic gymnastics , but I know both gymnasts and dancers are prone to on - the - job injury -- and the effects of those injuries can add up .
The behaviour of Australian cricket fans is of more concern than the thousands of spirited Barmy Army members set to descend upon our shores for this summer 's Ashes series , say Victoria 's police .
The number of English fans travelling to Australia is expected to easily surpass the 10,000 who came for the 2002-03 Ashes series because of last year 's victory and because of an online ticketing fiasco that saw thousands of English fans nabbing Ashes tickets meant for Australians .
There has been some discussion here about the Ashes .
Not the test series , the actual ones .
Apparently the Aussies ( a devious lot ) have said that when they win the series ( that 's IF they do , but they do n't think that way ) they want to take the small urn from its permanent place at Lord 's Cricket Ground back to Oz.
MCC say , on your bikes Cobber , because that urn is a gift , not a trophy , and it stays where it is .
What say the Aussies now ?
I 'm sitting here pulling my hair out because my roomate is watching the Masters on TV . I 'd rather drink battery acid than watch golf .
While semi - watching , I just realized something : while the golfer is setting up his shot , and about to swing , all the fans get very quiet for them . Then I thought about fans at sports games ( golf is n't a sporting event , it 's a hobby ) , and they scream , yell , and do their best to annoy the opposing team 's players and throw them off their game .
Why the hell do golfers escape that aspect ? The pressure and ability to block stuff out adds to the challenge . Why are they so special ?
This made me just hate watching golf on TV even more .
I love golfing .
Do n't understand watching it .
Also do n't understand courses that use carts .
None of that new - fangled crap for me .
Walk , and carry your bloody clubs .
so there are others out there other than myself that hate golf and believe its not a sport ? thats wonderful !
golf is a sport ... an incredibly boring sport ...
tennis players get the same ' silent treatment ' from spectators -- not exactly sure why ...
Bite me , Slappy .
Hatred of golf is for people with brain deficiencies .
One other thing that must annoy you . In all other sports ( yeah , golf is a sport ) ... there are refs and umps and all that . And the people playing the sports argue with those officials all the time .
In golf ... you gotta call fouls on yourself . And golfers do !
There ai n't nothing in the world better than golf . ( Well ... maybe one thing . But even that , you can eventually get enough of . You can never get enough of golf . )
Will Tom ever return to the Pats ?
Ever ? Yeah , next season .
It 's looking like he is out for the year , though depedning on his rehabilitation , he may try to be available for the playoffs .
It 's tough to say though .
My money is on Brady to return next year .
I do n't think he 's willing to let the previous season 's Super Bowl be his last .
Or it is possible you will stand there with a frozen grin on your face , unable to say anything remotely intelligent .
WE CAN HELP YOU !
Several of us A 2K'ers have created a support group to painlessly guide you towards appearing knowledgeable even if , like many of us , you are clueless .
They are called the Wildcard games .
You will need to invest a grand total of 7 minutes . Total . Max.
Please indicate , by noon on Saturday , Jan 8th , your picks on these 4 games :
NY Jets @ Indianapolis Colts
Baltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs
New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks
Green Bay Packers @ Philadelphia Eagles
The Jets aggravated me no end in Fantasy Football ( Sanchez was my quarterback ) , so this seems to me a perfectly good reason to pick the Colts , who also aggravated me , but not as much .
I 'm placing my faith that the Jet 's defense will kick in one more time .
Plus I like it that no one else seems to have faith in the Jets .
Besides this wild card round is just fodder for the real games when the Patriots start playing and ultimately take the whole burrito , ( enchiladas are n't classy enough for Tom Brady and the gang ) .
Instead of a coin toss - and because I know absolutely nothing about football - I 'm going to do it by which city I know / like better and see how well I do .
So my picks will be :
New York
Baltimore
New Orleans
Philadelphia
Just as an experiment to begin with , but I am fairly competititive in spirit , so if one of my teams makes it to the Super Bowl - I 'll watch it instead of the Andy Griffith show marathon and eat me some chicken wings and drink a beer or two .
Sounds fun to me ... ca n't hurt .
Is there a prize ?
in an article in toronto 's " globe and mail " newspaper , John Polanyi , a Nobel laureate and member of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Toronto , recommends that afghanistan farmers be allowed ( you might even say " be encouraged " ) to grow poppies ( opium ) legally .
he argues that there is a shortage of painkilling medication , particularly in poor , third world countries , and that afghanistan could supply the needed poppies at a lower price than commercially produced painkillers .
i saw the interview he gave on CBC - TV recently and he seems to know what he is talking about .
as he put it : " the afghan farmer has to make a living to feed his - often large - family .
we can force him to produce the poppies illegally and feed into the illegal drug market or we can buy the poppies from him and help provide pain - killing drugs . "
as i posted sometime ago , countries such as : france , australia and india are permitted to grow poppies legally for the production of drugs - why not allow the afghan farmers the same privilege ?
have a look at the article and see if you agree with him or not .
The problem with poppy cultivation is n't the growing of the crop itself .
The problem is oversight and marketing .
Opiates have legitimate medicinal uses .
Unfortunately , the product of the papver somniferum plant has far more monetary value on the black market than when sold to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers .
Thanks for the article and the background - I read both .
There would be problems though .
The criminal element that currently buy the crop are still going to try and get their hands on it , so the crops would need to be guarded .
That 's going to cost a fair bit and probably result in bloodshed .
Hottest world conflicts in the computer near you ! Live ! Entertaining ! Wild !
The future of the news reality shows , or whatever should one call it .
Kevin Sites touring the world 's conflict zones with digital technology that will allow him to blog and transmit images and videos from war ridden areas daily .
One can contact him there , or chat with him live on the website .
Now while I know he 's doing it voluntarily and probably for a shootload of money , I have to say I find the idea of such a project odd and somewhat disconcerning .
Will it start a new wave of journalists seeking out the most dangerous situations to sell their goods ?
Competition on who can go the farthest ?
And will that encourage the sides in conflict to up their performance , so to speak , getting international live coverage straight from the front ?
Especially if there will be more and more Keven Sites'es roaming the world ?
Thousands of journalists already do seek out war zones , sure .
But this is taking it to a whole new level , I think .
Anyway , I 'm confused about how I feel about it .
I will surely look in often to see where he 's at and will be curious about the reports and live videos .
It has a voyeuristic element to it , does n't it ?
Ah , what is this world coming to .
And what does the future of journalism hold for us ?
Can we control it in any way ?
What do you think ?
gus , that 's what 's making me uncomfortable .
it just seems like a stoopid idea to me .
but i wo n't deny that i am also curious , although it makes me feel kinda dirty .
partaking in making a violent conflict a part of entertainment culture .
well , more so than it already is . yecchh .
Everything in life has a positive , and a negative side .
The good thing about this is that they might be able to record what really is happening in certain areas of the world in case the governments of the world tell us different .
If they make money good for them !
If they survive many of these men come back home changed , and sometimes not for the better .
They could also come back wounded or sick .
To me , it 's a good thing to be able to choose how your going to die when it 's for a good cause .
There are incidents where the bastards in charge decide it would be best for a certain reporter to " die in conflict "
Mr. Sites better tread carefully .
Of course , I imagine he 'll have quite an entourage and that might ensure his safety from the more devious sorts .
The UN or at least some of the members threaten sanctions .
Sanctions , what sanctions could the UN impose , refuse to purchase the lifeblood of industry " OIL " ?
Iraq could on the other hand cut their production and cause the price of that commodity to go through the roof .
Is the threat of sanctions just another instance where the US and the UN is just blowing smoke ?
It 's blowing smoke as it 's the people who will end up suffering from any such move .
If the UN really wants to make a difference , they could threaten to pass a resolution !!!!!
Ooooooh ! That ought to scare ' em .... "
And Bush is clamering the loudest .
Does he , I wonder , think that would be his excuse to invade .
It would be WMD 's all over again .
I ca n't believe that even the crew that " owns " the US at the present time would do something as rash and ill conceived .
Let me start by saying that I love Morocco .
I 've been there a few times in the last 6 or 7 years and have become familiar with its people and customs and geography and unique challenges .
Each time I 've visited , I 've noticed immense , fast - paced progress , both economically and socially .
Since my first visit there a network of well - built highways has been built , enabling european and internal tourism and commerce to flourish .
I 've witnessed cell phones come on the market and virtually explode .
High speed internet is available .
House building and land development is through the roof .
Agricultural technology has taken off and enabled farmers to be profitable and efficient , as well as increasing the availability of affordable food to all Moroccans .
My aim for this thread is to periodically discuss new developments and economic initiatives in Morocco as they come about in the news , as well as any other news that is deemed curious or interesting .
I 'm interested in Morocco .
I know there are some cells there of folks who want to cause havoc but that is presumably not the whole population .
The country has seemed attractive to me for years .
At the least , I am interested in hearing more about it .
Don , could you be more specific about why Morocco is to be avoided ?
This all reminds me of myself sitting at a train station in italy at about 5:30 a.m. one morning .
My husband and I wandered in after buying our train tickets to get cappuccini and dolci before the ride ... and shared a table with two tourists from the US .
On my right was a table of what turned out to be moroccan laborers .
My xhub and the tourers were talking away about something and I glanced over at the ( moroccans ) and we started talking in poor italian , which is how I found out they were from Morocco .
Very polite sleepy early morning nice conversation .. I turned to the others and the lady said , " dear , you mus n't talk with them , they are dangerous . "
I ca n't remember what I said , but it was short , succinct .
That was a long time ago .
Not every immigrant from far away lands is the devil in disguise , and neither are all of us .
Well said , JLN !
I have n't been there myself but my 3 sons and a friend went a couple of years ago .
They said a ) it was one of the most beautiful places they had been and b ) it was the place in the world they had been most hassled and cheated .
I think , too , that as 4 young men travelling together , they were looked upon as a challenge by local youth .
They said there was fighting amongst kids in the street and this seemed to be normal and tolerated .
So it is a society with a very male testosterone - rich style .
The shops run by women were altogether less hassly , more friendly .
One thing they found particularly hard to deal with was other young men attaching themselves to their group and being undislodgeable ( a nwe word and it 's only 9 am ! ) .
My eldest who is especially friendly and tolerant tried to make friends with these people but in the end they all wanted something .
That can be dispiriting for the open - minded and open - hearted .
But they enjoyed their stay generally , would certainly not avoid it in future .
As for lumping all Islamic countries together as a no go area - what complete nonsense !
As we 're going to Turkey and Syria at the end of this month , and expect to have a wonderful trip as independent travellers , I am definitely making a political statement -
I do NOT lump all Muslims together , and believe that 98 % are friendly to travellers .
Most are undoubtedly anti - American and anti - Bush , but that is not a sentiment confined to the Islamists .
My engagement ring / wedding ring and other personal ring along with my husband 's wedding ring was stolen .
At least we assume so .
We went camping and put them together in the car .
After camping and coming home we searched high and low and could not find them .
We called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything .
So we had to assume some one stole them .
We did have the car unlocked at times so it is a definate possibility .
Really stinks at it was just our anniversary right before .
Yep , that stinks .
We were robbed one time right before Christmas .
Came home , and the basement door had been kicked in .
All they took were wrapped Christmas gifts , and all of my husband 's socks .
Sounds funny now , but at the time I felt very violated at the thought of strangers going through my house .
@mags314772 ,
Yes I can say the one thing was at least it was n't in my house .
The idea of some one going through your house is as bad as them taking Christmas presents .
Wow , the Afghanis are in for a life - changing shock to their culture and way of life .
Tribal leaders , international corporations , international governments and bordering neighbors will all be vying with each other and the Afghani people for a piece of the action .
It will be interesting to watch who takes what sides .
Will China and Russia now side with the Taliban to take over the country and exploit the riches ?
Will the US help the Afghani people to learn from our mistakes and protect their natural environment from strip mining ?
Will Al Queda now return to the country to enrich themselves with the profits ?
Will the lithium deposits take away from efforts by Al Gore and others to invest in and invent research and development in improved battery storage for the very young renewable clean energy industry in the U.S ?
I dont think that any vast deposits found in one land that barely exists as a state and has almost no industry will be a setup for a despotic regime or a surge of TAliban takeover of provinces within which are these deposits .
SInce much of it lies in the mountainous regions of the West and southwest , these are already the subject of the new campaign against a resurfacing TAliban .
These minerals , especially the Lithium , will need major processing before its in a commercial state for batteries .
Long term development for all kinds of batteries for entire new gizmos ( not just blackberries ) will be based on better and better lithium cells .
Most of the worlds recoverable deposits lie in south America lake deposits and in our own western North Carolina in vast quartz deposits .
If they found deposits of rhodium and platinum itd be a major reason to enter negotiations to help em develop their resources .
You can have all the rear metals in the world in your country , but the supporting infrastructer 's must be in place , I.E. roads , power plants , process facilties , WATER , tons and tons of WATER , chemical suppliers , etc.
So what may appear as a rich mineral bonanza , will be shot down for now and the forseable future , because the cost of extraction , is larger that any profit margin .
The Administrative and Legislative branches of our government ca n't agree on how to make a dent in our deficits .
The solution ?
Go on vacation for a month and appoint a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives to try to work out some sort of plan .
Their mission is to reduce next year 's deficit by $ 1. 2Tn over the next 10 years .
They must come up with a plan by Thanksgiving - roughly 100 days - that 7 of the 12 members can agree on .
If they fail , there will be across the board cuts .
If they succeed , their plan must pass the House and the Senate with no alterations .
I , too , am skeptical , edgar .
The 3 Dems and 3 Repubs from the House seem to be intractably committed to their parties ' more extreme wings .
The Senators are being described as " dealmakers , " willing to compromise at the end .
We will have to see .
In the meantime , if any of you find biographies of the 12 members of the super committee , please link or write your own profile of them .
I 've said elsewhere that I do n't think they 're expected to accomplish anything .
They may put out a proposal but it will probably fail in one chamber or the other .
Neither chamber can come to consensus on substantive reforms , imo , and the triggers will be pulled .
The triggers were specifically chosen because each one is desirable to one party and not anethema to the other .
It never was a good idea and only seemed to be a good idea to the morons .
There was never any reason to think that this was going to work , and now that it will not they are going to try to defuse the trigger ... but THAT might not work either .
I dont know what the Vegas odds of gutting the defense department is but I put it at around 30 % .
It was always going to happen at some point , but maybe 10-20 years down the line , not now .
If this happens it will be a major breaking of faith with the American people .
Millions of Americans went to war for America , and came back broken or otherwise gave up a lot , and now we look to take a huge chunk of their hide because Washington no longer works .
This , folks , is going to be a problem .
EDIT : " delay and pray " has not worked in Europe , and it will not work in America .
In both places we see from our so called leaders a massive refusal to step up to the plate .
Bullshit !!! we are our own people .
The reason we are fighting the worlds wars is because the very rich who dont want to pay their share of taxes want the protection of the government for the wealth and jobs they have imported to other countries .
What the majority of the U.S citizens get in return is nothing but a lack of jobs and a reduction in our ability to feed our families .
Time to plug yourself in for a recharge , youre starting to run down .
If you wanna defeat Obama , seems to me you need a candidate with something between their ears .
All I see is Bozo and friends on the GOP side .
( Hint : Id vote for a republican if one of substance showed up , Im not too thrilled with the job Obama did .
I think he wasted his capital on the health care right at the beginning of the worst economic situation weve seen in our lifetimes .
UNFORTUNATELY , you can not really think that any of the present gaggle of GOP candidates have got substance ) .
Thus the analysis that I have put up on A 2K in multiple places that the US Federal Government is corrupt , and is run by the corporate class .
We see the oppression of the people by the government in other areas besides economics though , for instance I have pointed out how this oppression is woven onto our sex law .
The oppressors should not get too comfy , as oppressors the world over are finding out they get over thrown by force of public will .
The oppressors of the American people will eventually suffer the same fate ...
Where is Theodore " Teddy " Roosevelt when we need him --- again ?
The greatest irony I 've seen here at a2k Hawkeye is although I agree with on the statement that the US is an oligarchy or a plutocracy I believe you have foolishly drunk the Kool - Aid to think the Tea Party is genuine in it 's pursuit to save the country from " our oppressors " when EVERY move they propose is a basic tenet to strengthen the status quo .
Clearly you are too blinded by your personal selfishness and greed to see and feel the rain falling on your head from your Tea Party overlords .
Governments exist for a reason .
Progressive governments exist and should continue to exist in order to protect it 's citizens from the raiding and looting hordes of the multibillion dollar conglomerates and banking institutions who themselves exist in order to set up a select small population into extreme wealth and power .
I am not of the Tea Party , I am a radical leftist formerly a revolutionary currently a socialist .
It could be argued that a better word is collectivist ...
I strongly support libertarian political actions because I want to see individuals once again free enough from government oppresion that they can choose to come together in collective effort .
What we have now is a sham socialism impossed by a government which is owned by the coporate class , whos only mission is to grab more wealth .
We are free from government oppression .
Now if we can free ourselves from our billion dollar overlords perhaps we can enjoy real freedom and get rid of our bought politicians .
The Euro countries are afraid to let Greece go bankrupt , because it will be followed by Spain and Ireland .
If that happens , the Euro 's value will drop to unimaginable levels , and inflation will hit all their countries .
The European Central Banks Euro policies continue to exacerbate the problems for Greece and the other Euro countries with huge deficits .
France and Germany are trying their best to prop up Greece with more loans and forgiving of loans , but that seems like a losing proposition when Greece really does n't have an economy that can pay back the loans they already have .
It seems like desperation times for the Euro zone countries , but the majority are in no position to assist Greece with their growing deficit .
How long will this plugging of holes in the dam last ?
Germany and France are in no position to save all of them when the water 's rush gets stronger by the month ( growing deficits ) .
Greece 's debt is 179 % of GDP .
How will they survive ?
I believe we 're on the rim of an economic maelstrom .
Greece is only the latest symptom of a financial disease that has become pandemic .
I believe that , too .
Rather like an individual who works hard , produces useful work , and saves for the future suddenly finding himself wiped out because of the acts of a central bank , somewhere .
You guys are depressing me .
Ca n't I just go back to blissful ignorance ?
After WWII , the recovery was fast .
There was pent up demand for everything after the war , because most civilians earned money building our war machines for four years , and there was hardly any consumer goods to buy .
Even food was put on rations .
What was " funny " to some degree was the " cheap " junk we imported from Japan , because Americans were ready to spend money .
I remember lighters from Japan were made from soda pop cans , and they must have sold millions of those .
It appears a global recession is on its way .
A bush league president and political party should never be near the steering wheel of the US economy .
Their reckless policies and ideology can only lead backwards to a 18th or 19th century society of robber barons and ideological cutthroats .
It 's too late ; we 've been a recession many months ago ; most families could not continue to live their lifestyles of a couple of years ago because food and fuel costs have increased to the point most could not keep up with those higher costs .
As family members lost their jobs and homes , many also lost their health insurance .
That 's a biggie for most families .
You can listen to our government about " not being in a recession , " but I see it different .
Some important cricket is going to be played out in the next coupla months :
Australia takes on SL ( or rather Australian spectators take on Murali ) ; India sweats it out with Pakistan ; SA prepare to face NZ .
There 's lots to talk about .
Would the Ozzies and Indians ( British are allowed , too ) want to talk over a beer or two ?
I 'm here !
Glad they gave Stuart McGill a run .
The New Year Test in Sydney is Aus vs India .
I went to the last Aus - India test .
We arrived , and the scoreboard read India 7-705 . Aarrggghhh !
I took a photo of it .
Was still a draw , though . Steve Waugh 's last Sydney Test .
Hope that does n't happen again !
AUSTRALIAN rock legend Billy Thorpe has died this morning after suffering a major heart attack overnight .
Thorpe , 60 , died in the early hours of the morning after he was rushed to Sydney 's St Vincent 's Public Hospital at 2am ( AEDT ) , a spokesman has said .
Did he do anything a non - Aussie may recognise ?
Billy moved to the US in 1976 .
Children of the Sun was released in 1979 Top twenty .
Billy headlined his own sold out tours through 1979 and 80 .
Sometime there abouts his record lable went belly up .
Polygram assumed the rights .
Lived as fast as he died .
At least in the early years .
They should have a one minute silence up at The Cross .
After strategically ' excising ' bits of Australia in order to thwart people smugglers ( you ca n't land in Australia if we pass a law to say it IS N'T Australia this week ) , our pint - sized PM has decided to think big .
How big .
Real big .
The Govt is planning to create a ' security zone ' that extends 1,000 nautical miles around the country .
This would allow the monitoring and possible interception of any vessel within the zone .
Amazingly , other nearby nations ( Indonesia for one ) are a bit put out as it extends Australian soverienty well into Sth East Asia .
And why ?
The USA has one ....
There must be some sort of international bench - mark for pissing off other nations in play here .
This Govt has also repeatadly said that it will take independent action to pre - emptively strike at ' terror ' and we are sourcing suppliers of cruise missiles .
Now , it is pretty obvious that Australia wo n't be attacked from the east ( NZ ) , the south ( Antarctica ) or the west ( big ocean then Madagascar ) .
So , ' security zone ' is shorthand for , ' You sneaky little brown people better not try any funny business ' .
Of course they just HAPPEN to be the most populous Muslim nation on Earth - of course we should always walk tall and talk tough when dealing with them .
Could you imagine how tough Washington would be if there was the ' Islamic Republic of Canada ' with a billion or more people sitting on their northern border ?
You will never ever appease Indonesia .
They could n't give a stuff about Australia no matter what we say .
They would have invaded us long ago if there was n't a big stretch of ocean in between .
If I were to describe accurately and succinctly my estimation of that post , australia , I might be banned .
I shall content myself by simply saying that you are utterly ignorant of where Stilly might have been , and what his experiences or feelings might be , nor do I see his whereabouts as forming the basis of any rational argument .
Perhaps fortunately , however , you have made no attempt to formulate any such argument .
Well was n't that progressive of them ...
This is the second time they 've done so .
The most amazing thing though is California , often described as the very heart of American liberalism , voted conservative on just about every one of the propositions out there .
They did approve assisted suicide , but I think voted against every other ' liberal ' proposal .
I honestly think the pendulum is beginning to swing back from the far left .
We can always hope .
Once the traditional marriage is safe , then I am confident the people will get busy to provide a way for gay couples to enjoy the same protections as married people do , and I think that will pass with scarcely more than a murmor .
A new report on global warming , the product of a task force of academics , business leaders and politicians , chaired by former Blair administration Transport Minister Stephen Byers and Republican Senator Olympia Snowe , is deeply unsettling .
I love when those that do n't get it claim there ca n't be global warming cause it 's 8 degrees and theres 3 feet of snow on the ground .
That 's actually one of the things ( record / increased snowfall ) that indicates global warning IS taking place .
What I do n't get is why some so vehemently deny global warming .
What is the benefit of denying that it is happening or accepting that it is possible ?
Ya learn something new every day ....
Ambergris is used in perfumes or as a perfume .
I thought it was a type of amber ( a tree resin product ) , but it is totally unrelated .
Ambergris is basically , sperm whale trace .
You know how hawks and coyotes vomit up the undigestible parts of their food ?
So do sperm whales .
The stuff the eject is fould and gross , but after it floats in the sun , on the ocean , for many years , it becomes ambergris - worth a small fortune too .....
There was nothing the 19th century whalers prized more highly -- a good haul of ambergris could allow all the ships officers to retire , or buy their own ships -- and allow the sailors to get famously drunk , until they were robbed and went lookin ' for a new berth ...
I found that quite interesting .
Imagine breaking open a chunk of a ambergris and discovering something like that ...
" Hey , Kris , what the hell is this thing inside the ambergris ? "
" Let me have a look .
I believe that is the hard beak of a giant squid ! "
That initial article said it was banned in the US under some endangered species thingie -- why , though ?
It seems like it 's pretty separated from any harm to the animal .
( If they kill one for it , if they get anything at all they 'll some foul - smelling bile that has to be floated on the sea for 10 years or more ... )
The ambergris itself is considered an endangered species , soz .
It is considered to be a floating ecosystem , sort of a microcosm of a rain forest , and every time one is destroyed scientists lose valuable information that might have been used for discovering a cure for cancer or some other dealdly malady .
Obama dramatically escalated the extrajudicial killings by America around the world ( mainly in Yemen , Pakistan and Afghanistan ) since taking office .
For example , in his first year in office America carried out more drone attacks in Pakistan than Bush 's entire presidency .
The next year ?
He more than doubled his own increased rate .
Obama is sending out these drones to kill people at a rate of once every 4 days .
Bush 's average was about once every 50 .
We 've made a new generation of enemies in Pakistan and Afghanistan for these assassinations ( and the " night raids " Obama escalated in Afghanistan ) .
Other than Bin Laden , nobody we are killing had anything to do with 9/11 .
A decade later many of the young men we are assassinating ( along with the civillians that constitute one third of the number killed by these drones ) must have been kids when that happened .
Do you think this is a good idea ?
If this was Bush would you be protesting it ?
Voting against him ?
Why can Obama , the greatest drone murderer in history , get away with it with hardly a word about it ?
He even gets away with cracking jokes about predator drones while I know damn well that most of you here would have excoriated Bush for something like that .
So why is it ?
Do you all just not know that Obama has escalated the killings done in your name or do you just not care anymore ?
Is war cool now ?
Are these killing moral now ?
Why are the lives Bush was killing more valuable than the ones that Obama is killing ?
Why are you guys gonna vote for this warmonger ?
When you go on a crusade you do n't pull any punches with your headlines , do you , Robert ?
That 's a bit over the top , don'cha think ?
I stated long ago that I no longer support him .
I will vote third party , if at all , since neither major party wants to nominate somebody with my values .
I see your point , which you made well on the other thread .
I had a discussion a week or so ago with a old lib friend thinking about voting for Ron Paul , and I went on about my old theory about watching for the company someone keeps .
That 's from my hematology days , when if you find a blast cell in a peripheral smear , it was very likely a progenitor of the cells around it , thus helping identify the leukemia .
( Long ago , do n't know what they do on that now . )
Thus , I might like a Republican , but would worry about the administration that came along with him or her .
I ended with saying I 'm not all so happy about the " company Obama keeps " either .
I convinced her , but my conviction on this is shallow .
She and I are both in despair about Obama for reasons already well discussed on a2k re his get along mode .
I 'm not sure she is as troubled by U.S. actions around the world as I am , but I think so .
I 'm interested in third party mavericks , but have trouble envisioning how that would work out even if I approved of the candidate .
Could Gary Johnson work out ?
Huntsman as an independent ?
Or , get elected in the first place ?
Given a Republican in office , one of those in the present batch of candidates , I have more trouble not seeing things get worse in some ugly ways re the economy and how life would work for the struggling with little income .
I 've despaired with presidents before , though .
So , lets say a Republican is elected - I can imagine increasing polarization in the citizenry as an outcome .
It might result in real change - but in just what ways ?
You sound like you 'd rather see that than put up with Dem mediocrity any further .
On that , I both see your point and am not there yet myself .
Why , I 'll say I fear things being worse ( to me ) for a while might spiral out of control .
Here 's a funny one : when I got a job working for the local college I had to show my birth certificate before they would hire me .
Mine had been mislaid and I 'd asked if there was any way I could work in lieu of finding it , but they said : no they would not hire me without a birth certificate .
But Barack Obama has yet to produce a valid birth certificate and is no president of the United States .
Not only does it take less paperwork to become president of the United States than a tutor at a local college , but the US constitution requires the President must be a natural born citizen !
Without requiring proof of birth we have waived this constitutional requirement .
@Muarck , Note : this is not conservative or republican agenda .
I 'm a democrat who voted Hillary Clinton .
This is just about gross violations of the U.S. constitution .
Who are you trying to fool ?
Obama produced a valid birth certificate .
It was verified by the State of Hawaii .
It 's been upheld in numerous court proceedings .
It 's been investigated by just about every news organization out there .
But you do n't have an agenda , yeah right .
A certified copy of a birth certificate issued by the state of birth is valid legal proof of birth , acceptable in a court of law .
NO ONE gets their ORIGINAL certificate of birth .
Those always stay on file in wherever the state keeps their vital records .
Obama has shown a certified copy .
It 's been examined several times and declared valid .
The State of Hawaii has verified the original .
Give it up . He 's legal
according to the AP .... here 's a local link
I 've been wondering when that 'd be called !
CNN has both Missouri and NC at " 100 % reporting " but they 're still not colored in .
I am shocked that this happened .
I am not unhappy but I am shocked .
The tension and animosity on the street in NC is palpable .
I 've been threatened physically twice .... like I give a shit ....
I do tend to stir the pot I realize .
Last night at my gig some drunks late night were discussing what to call Obama ... bandying the usual right wing talk around and I said " I suggest you call him the motherfucking President Elect " .
He was n't sure what to say in response to that so he paid his tab and left
After last night 's events in Brussels , it 's clear that the UK does n't want to be a part of the Europe ( or just the EU ? ) anymore .
The continent can cope without the British .
But can the UK go to a prosperous future without the Euro , without the continent ?
What alliances are now possible ? Just the USA , or the a re - organised Commonwealth ?
Where will be the future place of this country among Europe , Russia , China , the USA ?
The UK has said " Bye , bye Europe " .
I hope they know the meaning of " Auf wiedersehen " !
@Walter Hinteler , I ca n't remember where I read the analysis , but the conclusion which made sense to me was that currency boundaries ultimately implied federal boundaries .
To be anthropomorphic , the " UK psyche " resists federal union with Europe as evidenced by their original reluctance to join the Eurozone .
This latest decision is symptomatic of that resistance but economic events will ultimately decide whether " resistance is futile " .
It 's also a sovereignty issue -- and sovereignty is something which the EU has never effectively addressed .
Ever crucial issue is put up for a plebecite , or a vote by nation -- and the population of one or more countries , or the governments of one of more countries , torpedo the deal .
As a " union , " it 's farcical .
Not too long ago , when Barack Obama campaigned for the presidency , he was all about human rights .
And man did he chastise the Republicans ' approach to them .
Time and time again , Obama emphasized ( and I 'm quoting from memory here ) that under his rule America would n't lead the world through the example of its power , but through the power of its example .
One of his first acts as president was to announce the shutdown of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , which had come to symbolize the Bush administration 's fast , loose , and secretive approach to human rights .
Last week , the Obama administration had a perfect opportunity to act on its rhetoric , to set an example of America 's new spirit , to specifically deliver " change we can believe in " .
To understand this opportunity , you have to remember that Guantanamo Bay was just the tip of the iceberg .
The rest of the iceberg , hidden underneath the waterline from public scrutiny and media symbolism , exists a system of CIA prisons in foreign countries .
When the CIA suspects people of connections to terrorism , it snatches them off the streets wherever they live , flies them to those secret prisons , and interrogates them .
Credible reports allege that the CIA uses torture to extract information from them .
( I 've written about one of the victims a little over three years ago ) .
When some of the victims are trying to pursue their cases in federal court , the Bush administration tried to throw out their cases on a theory about government secrets .
Obama , consistent with the rest of his human rights rhetoric , sharply criticized Bush for it .
But now that Bush 's secrecy theory is before an appeals court , Obama is changing his mind .
Without qualifications , he is now sticking to the Bush position that torture victims can not sue the CIA , because the torture is a state secret .
" Change we can believe in " ?
Yeah right .
That is so a year ago !
It 's what most politicians would do ... but still ... sigh .
The hell of it is to whom do we turn .
The Bush and Regan policies that have put us in this position ?
We all voted for Obama because of these policies but where do we turn to really gain a government of the people for ALL the people .
Democrat , republican , all I see are crooked politicians who are only interested in thier own gain and screw the rest of us .
Well it was n't just campaign promises , he repeated it in his inauguration , when he already had the presidency in hand .
" We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals . "
Apparently he was missing some qualifiers , so I 'll fix it for him :
" We sometimes reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals when it is politically convenient . "
Yeah , I just saw this for the first time too .
Does n't look good , but I do n't know anything beyond what 's here .
Thomas -- when 's the last time you saw me say ANYTHING about Obama , yay or boo ?
I 'm still in politics detox mode and still just not following this stuff .
Also just plain not on A 2K much .
This happened to be recently replied to when I checked in just now .
I wonder which couple of years he is referring to .
The power of propaganda .
Even half - ways intelligent people just automatically repeat this propaganda that 's been driven into their heads .
Interesting use of subject / object pronouns .
I have been busy the last few days .
Today is the first I heard about the story on NPR .
I admit I do n't know the facts but on it 's face I disagree with the decision .
It 's 4 days old ?
It certainly had n't made it into my paper unless I skimmed over it .
Gushing like teenagers about their first crush ? I do n't gush Thomas .
This is n't really an endorsement of torture and rendition , is it ?
With nothing to go on except the link to the NYT article , it looks more like there is n't going to be legal action against CIA and the unnamed Boeing subsidiary for activities they were assured were legal at the time .
I never felt obliged to report every screwup made by the previous administration .
There were so many better qualified people to handle that .
I 'm very close to breaking point ,
i 've loved the same girl for about six years .
I 've kept it to myself forever , then told a friend a few months ago cause I just could n't cope anymore .
Then a week 1/2 ago , I declared my love for the girl in a text when I was drunk .
She eventually replied a couple of days later being unbelievably kind about it , which has really just made me fall even deeper ( if this is possible ) .
I told her she would n't hear from me for a while , you know , so I can attempt to move on .
So now I 'm at the start of the move on phase , but I 'm just stuck .
I cut off most of my hair and I 've started exercising and changing my diet to try to alter the chemicals in my body to make me feel better that way , but does n't seem to be working , i 'm still miserable .
A song about love will come on my itunes ( pretty much every song in the world ) or a song that reminds me of her , and i 'll just break down .
I feel like just dropping out of uni and getting on a flight to australia and never coming back .
During a really low point last week I cut myself ( which i had n't done in years ) just because i had so much pent - up emotion , i had to let it out somehow .
I really do n't know what to do or how to help myself be happy again .
People say time is a healer but I do n't know if I 'll be able to hold out that long !
Find activities to occupy your time .
There has to be something you really enjoy doing ?
Set some goals for yourself . i.e. :
- Go to the gym 5 times a week for an hour a day .
- Read x books in a month .
- Platinum all the God of War games .
- Meet one new person a day and engage in a meaningful conversation .
- Learn a new skill ( could be playing an instrument , drawing , trying a new sport , web design , etc. ) .
Just some examples .
Find an activity you like , set some goals , stick to them .
The key is to occupy yourself and meet new people .
Maybe make a new playlist on itunes for starters , with happy music . ' Do n't stop ' by Fleetwood mac , etc.
Things that do n't make you think of her .
Try , like / \ / \ suggested , getting a hobby , going to the gym etc.
It wo n't be easy , but it 's just one of these things in life .
Try counting all the things that you do have in life ,
sure you might not have her , but I 'm sure you have a number of other things .
You 're in uni ar n't you ??
Well , a large percentage of the population do n't have that , and I 'm sure you can finish the list .
It might seem impossible at the moment , but pick yourself up and live life with as much energy as you can .
Talking to people on here is always a place to start , have made some wonderful friends on here
Turn to religion .
When I was in your exact same position I turned to religion and Islam has worked very well boosting up my self - content .
I really like this girl and she 's in a few of my classes at university .
Everytime i look at her i find her looking banck at me .
Regardless I do n't know her that well but i fancy her a lot .
I was going to ask her out but for the past few weeks i 've been waiting for the right time ( which never comes , partly coz i 'm scared ) .
But being valentines day , should i ask her out and give her a card , or would that be cheesy .
Maybe i should just wait for valentines to go .
I see her tomorrow and i could approach her .
I sometimes worry what her mates will think of me , i do n't know i 'm nervous but it has to be done so i can move on i guess
Forget about the friends ; if she 's a nice girl , go for it !
Be casual , as you run the risk of coming on too strong if you do anything seriously Valentine 's - y.
I would suggest waiting until Thursday or so ( let the V - day aura float by a bit ) , and then ask her if she 's got plans Sunday afternoon for coffee .
Low pressure , maximum talking time .
Good luck !
Well , in my estimation , while it is " romantic " to ask on Valentine 's day , it 's also high - pressure .
It 's your decision , obviously .
Either way , coffee date ( or something similar . )
And do ask !
Ask as soon as you can manage to get it off your chest .
Asked my girlfriend what fantasies she wants to indulge in , turns out she wants to have a threesome with a lesbian / bi friend of hers that 's wanted to * * * * her for ages .
And yes the third party is fit and has let my gf touch her before .
My girlfriend is straight but she gets a kick out of pleasuring people , if that makes sense .
I 'm really kind of split on the issue tbh , I do n't have much experience with this sort of thing , if I was in a no - strings relationship they would be no stopping me , but I ca n't help feeling that going through with it would spoil things between us .
But then again we 're young and it is something I 'd like to kick off the bucket list , as it were .
Anyone have any experiences with this before ?
Good or bad ?
What should I look out for / be careful of , really do n't want to ruin things with my girlfriend , but the idea of a threesome is thrilling , not gunna lie .
Not really , threesomes in relationships can really cause issues ,
not to mention the reality is oft very different from the fantasy .
Im sexually open minded but theres no way id share my gf with a boy or girl .
If im single yeah sure , attached no way .
If my gf suggested it id tell her no , straight out .
Sorry but i dont share .
Oh and ive had threesomes before someone says it - both MMF and FFM
If you are n't planning on being with this girl forever then go for it .
If you 're engaged or some * * * * then best not to .
If her friend has wanted to ' f * * k her for ages ' I doubt it will end well
Apparentley threesomes can really ruin relationships , as they can make people insecure and unconfident .
Fantasy is sometimes better than reality .
If you have any insecurities at all , then I would recommend you not do it .
Like people have said , in theory , it 's great .
In reality , things are a lot more complicated .
I 've been with my girlfriend for well over a year now , and I 'm quite selfless towards her .
I do everything I can to make her life easier and better , and we both love each other .
It means that I spend generously if needed and put a lot of time and effort into the relationship .
However , the other night , I brought up " the future " .
As in , thinking about where we 'd be a couple years from now and how serious she was about staying with me .
Turns out , that she did n't really like me that much when we started dating and she was just seeing how things went ( although now she says she is very happy , but surprised , that she has stayed with me this long ) .
I asked her what she thought about where we 'd be and she said she does n't want to think about that , and that I should be happy about the experiences we 've had ( which I am ) .
My issue is that , should I continue putting so much effort into her if it just seems like I 'm " what 's good right now " for her , although it seems as if she does n't want to make any plans or even hope to stay together for a long time .
It just seems unfair that I 'm putting in a lot more effort into this relationship and that if we did break up , she 'd have gained a lot more than I did as a result .
Any thoughts ?
In your situation I would say enjoy the moment you 're in now .
Currently I 'm on the fence in regards to getting more serious with a guy who is technically still married , has two children and has openly told me does not want to get married again or have any more kids .
If you ever find yourself in a situation like this thinking about the future early on is a must in my opinion because there is a lot more at stake .
My boyfriend has one of those jobs where he 's on call a lot .
This year he 's on call for our anniversary .
This happens a lot .
He said we 'll not make reservations but we will make plans etc but not to bank on it .
I 'm not angry at him - I 'm in uni and I know how it is for things to change suddenly .
But I need to find a way to cope with this .
If I get all dressed up and sit waiting , he often texts me saying he has to cancel .
The disappointment is horrible .
If I do n't get ready , he comes home and I 'm in my pjyamas , not showered or ready in anyway .
It ruins the night because I have to run around and get ready and I do n't get to do any of the things I wanted to .
Is there anyway to
Bless you I know where you 're coming from .
My boyfriend is a bobby so he often has to stay late because of a job , he 's been hours and hours before getting back .
It makes it harder because we 're in an LDR so we have little time together anyway and with me at uni and him with only two days off a week now in comparision to the three / four it 's hard .
I do n't think you can not get disappointed .
The job demands it .
I realise that and sounds like you do too but it does n't make it any easier .
It 's just something we have to deal with .
Value the moments you do get to spend together , try not to plan things in advance if things are likely to cancel but be prepared for a bit of spontaneity , maybe have an outfit already in your head you could wear at last minute ?
It 's frustrating , you 're not alone in feeling the way you do .
I 'm studying abroad for a year and my boyfriend is going to come visit me a few times times .
Should I pay for some / half / any of his plane ticket ?
I feel bad when I have all this spare loan money and he 's having to save up for weeks to come see me , which is something we both want .
What do I do ?
I 'd discuss it with him -
I did n't do abroad , but when my ex and I were apart he 'd pay for his tickets and I 'd pay for everything whilst he was staying at mine - food , transport etc ( when he let me anyway ) .
So really it depends on how much the tickets are costing .
I guess as he 's having to save up that living costs wont cover it .
I 'd suggest either half , or if it makes him feel less bad about it , alternate - so he pays for the first trip , you pay for the second etc.
When I lived abroad my boyfriend at the time would pay for his flights
( they were n't much luckily ) and I would pay for most of the stuff when he was there ; eating out ... etc .
So my life 's been quiet now for a pretty long length of time ...
i'v had the occasions of seeing guys , but it never ends good or lasts long .
Since november last year i hav n't been in a proper relationship and life 's getting a bit too quiet for my liking .
I ca n't seem to meet any new genuine guys .
Their all ' manwhores ' to put it bluntly .
Some that i meet , i 'll be physically attracted to them .. but they have no personality to them .. you could say their like male barbie dolls .
However , some i will meet who have such a lovely personality , but i wont be attracted to them physically .
I ca n't seem to find someone with that ' connection ' if you know what i 'm saying .
Im starting to feel like it 's me who is the problem .
I ca n't seem to find anyone who is n't just interested in sex ...
advice please ! ?
Use your gold digger ability and find a rich man .
Meh i have the same problem just in reverse .
It does get a bit demoralising sometimes when everyone around you is in a relationship , especially now which is probably the worst time of year to be single .
I would n't blame yourself though , you probably just have n't had an opportunity come along .
I 've met plenty of nice girls at uni but it takes a lot for me to actually develop feelings for someone , and i ca n't say i 've met anyone who i genuinely have feelings for .
I 'd rather wait until i do then find a girlfriend for the sake of it - try and think of things that way ?
Just have to keep putting yourself out there i guess , if you 're constantly meeting new people or getting better acquainted with people you already know , an opportunity will come up eventually .
Theres a fair chance you 've caught someones eye already and they 're keeping quiet about it
So me and my ex broke up about 2 and a half months ago .
Do n't know how it all happened but she said she 'd like to see me during the Christmas holidays .
Now I had this weird thing going on with this breakup .. for the first 2 weeks I felt totally heartbroken , then I was getting on good for a while , then went back to being really sad , etc.
Before I came back I felt like I was over it ; then I came back , and suddenly , yet again feel unhappy .
It 's really goddamn annoying .
Either way , from what I 've heard , she is n't really the same kind of person she was when we were together ( in a good way for me ; apparently like the kind of girl I 'm not interested in ) , so meeting with her might totally kill whatever residual feelings there are and I can get on with my life .
Or it wo n't work and I 'll spiral back into sadness .
Or we may get back together , since she told me she might feel differently in the future . ( ie , want me back , after a break that 's less ' stressful ' ; not that we ever had a stressful time .. ) .
I do n't think this is ideal , but I 'm an idiot . I know I still feel kind of possessive over her ..
I hate the thought of her with another guy .
So should I meet with her ? Or not ? Or delete her out of my life entirely ? or what ..
depending on what you want .
if you want her back , do it .
if you want to be over her , do n't go .
I would say 90 % chance that will end up feeling even more sad than you are if you go see her , coz feeling do n't just die in 2 months ( unless there was nothing at the start ) .
I met up with my ex after 2 years of no contact at all and still feelings came back .
so yeah , do n't fool yourself . whatever that girl is doing now is probably just a pretend , trying to move on , be a changed person , ect ect .
Do n't expect to feel nothing when you see her .
ok its very important to know this quote : " Once a girl leaves her boyfriend , the only reason she might wanna be back is to hurt her bf "
Dude , do n't meet up with her even if you love her to death because once you have broken up , there is no way back and all this meeting will do to you is to make you feel upset afterwards .
I was in the similar situation couple of momth ago and i just kept this girl away from me and you ought to do the same since once something is over , then it is OVER
I really need advice .
Me and my boyfriend started dating when we were 16 , and we 're now at uni still going out .
He 's always been the sweetest guy , I mean really nice and funny but these past few months things have changed .
He 's had problems at home lately , and things have been really tough for him .
Im surprised how well he dealt with it all .
But recently I 've learnt not to bring it up in conversation or he 'll get really angry about it .
I do n't want to go into details but lately he 's been getting agry at the slightest things , and if I ca n't calm him down he 'll get violent especially after a drink .
He 'll always laugh it off afterwards as if he didnt mean it , and I know he doesnt because he is a good guy .
I 've tried talking to him about it several times , telling him I 'll leave him if he does it again but it hasnt stopped , and he has such a hold on me I dont think I could never leave him .
Im so emotionally drained and dont want any friends to know because they 'll just think bad of him , when really he is good deep down .
Sorry for the rambling , I just needed to get that out .
I 'm posting anonymously because what I am going to say is very personal .
Just over two years ago my girlfriends step - father was hurting her mum .
My girlfriend went to help her mum and in turn was hit over the head by a glass bottle . As you might expect the police were called and the prick was arrested .
He appeared in court the next day and plead not - guilty to assaulting her mum and assaulting her to her injury ( serious assault in scotland ) .
Now this is where my story gets really sick .
I type this and I am full of rage .
My girlfriends mum writes to the court and asks for her husbands bail conditions to be dropped as well as for the charges to be dropped .
She tells the court NOT to write to her at her own address or phone her home - this stopped my girlfriend from finding out what her mum was up to .
In Scotland , domestic abuse charges are not dropped if a victim requests for them to be dropped .
Though the bail conditions were dropped by the High Court in Edinburgh - this allowed the cowardly little prick to contact my girlfriend , her mum and enter the family home .
We found this out on December 23rd 2009 at about 7. 30pm when her mum phoned her to say her husband was back in the house and wanted to talk about what happened .
We phoned the police because as far as we were aware bail conditions were still in place .
There was nothing they could do .
Her mum kicked her out on Christmas Eve 2009 to allow the prick to stay .
I was raging .
Seeing my girlfriend in tears at 16 years old was absolutely heart - breaking for me .
I did not know how to help but all I did was worry and worry .
My behaviour started to change , I had recently started a career in the Merchant Navy but due to stress I started to develop problems .
I was eventually referred to a psychologist by my GP to deal with anxiety .
When the case went to trial , her mother lied and said my girlfriend attacked him .
The * * * * was found not - guilty .
My girlfriend was heart broken .
I lost it , I went absolutely crazy .
If my mum had not calmed me down then I would be in prison just now .
Two years on and my girlfriend has forgiven her mum .
They live in a flat and the mum disappears at the weekend - 10 points if you can guess who she goes to see .
I HAVE NOT FORGIVEN HER MUM .
I do not visit the flat when her mum is in .
I have had arguments with her mum where I have said some absolutely vile things which I am not in the least bit proud about .
I have asked my girlfriend to stay with her dad as I still worry .
Basically me not liking her mum affects our relationship a little bit - if we were ever to take the next step and eventually get married then I do not know how we would do it , though my girlfriend assures me that we would manage somehow .
I still think about the incident a lot .
What I am trying to say is that domestic abuse does not just affect you - it will affect everyone you care about .
Please take what I have said to heart and leave this guy .
Been with a guy for over 3 years .
He 's been acting really weird recently .
He has n't picked up literally 7/8 of my calls .
Has n't returned any texts either .
I did get to speak to him the last time I rung him ( after him blanking 7/8 calls ) and I asked him what 's up but he did n't tell me ( this was over a month ago ) .
The fact that its a long distance relationship does n't make it any better .
He did this before once two years ago as well over nothing but I ca n't really remember how it proceeded ... i guess he just gradually starting calling again .
Apart from this , we have had a very loving and almost perfect relationship .
I 'm starting to lose trust in him now .
I do n't know if I 'm overreacting , but I just feel really hurt about the way he 's neglecting me again and I 'm literally crying as I write this .
I let him get away with it last time but I 've had enough .
I do n't know what I aim to achieve writing this on a student forum , but any ideas on what should I do ? is it worth ending the relationship ?
I do n't wanna ring him any more because I feel insulted that he just casually blanks my calls .
And asking him does n't help either since he 's not gunna tell me .
Hmm ... good few issues here .
Personally , I do n't think long - distant relationships would be successful .
The playing hard to get , in reflection to what others have said , is clearly not to way to go , since you 're already living far from each other already .
I think that there 's a range of possibilities as to why he 's acting this way :
1 ) He 's got something to hide .
If you 're saying he acted this way before about 2 years ago and then perfectly fine later on , there 's clearly something going on in his mind .
I do n't know if that 's cheating or if there 's something else , but there 's clearly something he 's not sharing with you
2 ) He 's fed up with the relationship .
3 ) He 's autonomous and needs a LOT of space .
I 'm exactly the same .
Even if it 's a long distant relationship , sometimes receiving phonecalls ( depending on how often you 'd call him ) could actually affect his perception on how he feels about the relationship .
I think if you were to give him a ' taste of his own medicine ' then effectively you might receive the response you 're expecting but I think what 's missing here most is communication .
When you see him next time , do n't criticise or start questioning him .
Just express your worries to him and maybe you 'll get something out of him .
Edit : I do n't understand the neg .
Ok so I am female and like males , always have , obsessed with a few male celebs and see myself wth guys .
However occassionally I seem to have feelings for older females but I 'm not sure if they are like sexual feelings and it 's quite confusing .
For the first time there is a female who I like whos quite a bit older and I definitely have feelings .
I know that she is n't straight .
I deliberately try to talk to her and spend time with her even though shes clearly quite a bit older .
Perhaps they are more feelings because I look up to the person ?
I 'm really not sure , does anyone have any ideas ?
What does this mean ?
it seems strange when I am physically attracted to men ?
If you 're physically attracted to men and you 're not sexually aroused by her , I 'd say you have your answer there It might be that you get nervous and your heart beats faster because you are anxious to please her , or her opinion of you matters to you ?
If you scour the forums and do a search , you 'll see that you 're not the only one who has ever felt like this about a teacher of the same gender .
I used to - in fact , still ! - attach to female teachers and tutors a lot .
My counsellor had great fun dissecting it and telling me how I 'm sexually attracted to mother figures , but he was just an arse
I was n't in a relationship with this guy but we 've been seeing each other .
In first year we were always together in the same group of friends ..
it was fine .
Now in second year , he 's decided he does n't want to see me anymore .
He wants to be ' friends ' .
But I know he does n't really want to be friends at all .
I think he 's got someone else .. and that 's why he 's finished it but I do n't really care that he 's finished it .
What I do care about is that I 've been completely cut out .
He lives in the same place as me and has n't spoken to me once since .
I 've been cut out of nights out , get togethers .. etc all because I 'm not seeing him anymore .
This really upsets me , I want to be friends with him and I 'm willing to be but he seems to have cut me out so now I 'm not seeing other people either
Really hate it .
What can I do / say ?
Other people have cut me out because I 'm not with him anymore either !
This is what you do :
In future you make your own friends , not someone elses .
This is what you say :
Oh well , life 's not over .
My ex cut me out as soon as he got a new gf even though he promised to be friends , and that was 2 months ago
so my best piece of advice is try to move on
its bloody hurtful and hard
at first i spent the first 5 weeks cryingmy eyes out not sleeping , then it ended up that i felt i had done something wrong and therefore he dumped me
he let me blame myself and for weeks i kept thinking what if i had said this or done that , and then i found out him and his new gf were togther behind my back and i was nothing to do with it , .
So i think if you have like one other friend go out with them , maybe get a job or hobby and meet new people show him you dont care these boys love to think we are sitting at home waiting for their text which we might be but they cant know that
I have never done something like this before , but i have nobody to ask / talk to for advice as i cant tell anybody i know
my ex boyfriend had been with me for about 7 months when he went to uni he cheated on me and dumped me .
He is now in a official relationship with the girl he cheated on me with , becuase of this we have no spoken since he dumped me 2 months ago
it was a VERY VERY VERY bad break up
However when we did break up i was a bit of a idiot and begged him not to leave me becuase i was in love with him ,
However ive been feeling ill for a few weeks and went i went to the doctor she said im potentially pregnant .
Im freaking out
yes i need to do a test but i dont know when as i cant let anybody find out ,
also i feel i cant tell nmy ex as he thinks everything i do is for his attention to gain him back ,
if i tell him i might be pregnant he willl assume im lying to break up him and his new gf which im not but i dont know what to do
im scared and i dont know how i can tell hiim without him accusing me of being a liar .
She said you 're " potentially pregnant " ?
What kind of a doctor would say that without giving you a test ?
do a test and get it all over and done with
How about you do a test first and then think of the how to approach it ?
... take it from one who knows , no Doctor is going to tell you that you might be pregnant , and then send you home to deal with it .
I do n't understand why you have n't done a pregnancy test .
they only cost about GBP 3 or so .
Get on and do it and then sort yourself out .
Go straight to the doctor .
Like get up and go now .
They 'll give you another test just to make sure ( however pregnancy tests are rarely wrong when they read positive ) .
They will discuss your options with you and probably direct you towards some people who can give you counselling if you ask .
Your options are obviously : termination , continue with pregnancy and have the child adopted , continue with pregnancy and keep the child .
First off , it 's best that I explain that I 've barely any experience with girls .
I 'm in my second year of uni and I , um , ' opened my account ' in the sexual world the other night with a girl at my student union .
We 've met a few times before and have quite a few mutual friends , so she was n't a complete stranger .
Went back to hers for the night ( she chose that location because she had lectures the following morning ) and thought I handled the actual sex relatively well ...
The problem I have lies in the aftermath .
I can be pretty insecure at times ( it 's a wonder I actually made it back to hers , because I was worried I was imposing too much ) , and when I woke up I panicked and said I had to go and get some work done ( which I genuinely did , although thinking back on it , it was a weak reason to leave ) .
She decided not to go in for her lecture ( which I eventually realised was probably a hint for me to stay for a bit ) and we had a pretty friendly chat whilst I collected my phone , keys etc. together .
She even asked if I wanted her to come back to mine , but I refused and said something stupid like ' nah it 's okay , have a lie in ' , which I 've been kicking myself for .
I just got myself into a panic and had a mental block .
So I left , and sent her a light - hearted text a couple of hours later apologising for leaving so hastily and hoping that she had a good night ... and did n't get a response .
From here , I do n't know where to go .
To her , I probably came off as someone who does this all the time , and she was just one girl on a list of dozens I 've had one night stands with .
I just felt like I was a bit clinical and almost rude , especially with her asking if I wanted her to come back with me .
All I want to do now is somehow show her that I 'm not an absolute prick , without seeming too desperate or clingy .
I realise the error of my ways , and have beaten myself up over it massively ever since I left hers ...
I do n't think it 's a completely irretrievable situation , because she 's genuinely a lovely girl , and I reckon I can convince her I 'm not the womanising idiot she ( probably ) thinks I am. .. but my lack of experience with girls leaves me with no idea what to do .
Help , please ! ? ! ?
i see what you mean .
i 'd suggest giving her another text asking perhaps to meet up - cinema , dvd , or grab a coffee / lunch before lectures or something .
if she ignores this too then just move on to the next
then again , she might n't want anything serious , so just go slow .
Just text her and invite her to go out .
To clarify are you just looking to ' have fun ' with the girl , or are you cool with the idea of going a little serious ?
I get the impression she likes you and is maybe looking for something a little bit serious than occasional banging ..
I 'm not really sure , to be honest .
I kinda wanna take it one step at a time .
Asking her out for a cuppa could be a good idea , although I do n't want to do that just as a way of saying sorry .
I 'd rather clear the air first and show her that I know I made a mistake before getting into anything else with her .
you complete bloody numpty
you have learnt a valuable lesson
I 'm scared as to how he might react and it 's been 4 weeks and I 've still not found the perfect moment to tell him .
Also I 'm afraid what if he does n't want to keep it when I really do .
Although he 's a couple of year older than me ( 19 ) , he can act really immature , aggressive , and violent at time .
My parents have come to terms with it now after having little mini heart attacks , it 's just how can I break it to him ?
I think you should break it to him gentally .
Make sure your having a proper convo like one on one and eye contact , then break it to him .
Remember it will be a shock to him but hopefully in the end he will pull though and surport you .
I do n't think there is a way to tell him other than just being straight to the point .
Regardless of his reaction or personal feelings about pregnancy or abortion , he has a right to know .
Talk to him about what you want to do and what he would like to happen .
If you agree , great . If you ca n't then talking to your parents might be the next best thing .
Well he asked you to get the morning after pill , did you say you would ?
If you agreed to take the morning after pill but did n't then that 's quite unfair and he will be annoyed .
It 's obvious he did n't want a baby because he was using contraception and even though it failed he did say he wanted you to take the morning after pill , so do n't be surprised if he does a runner .
You just have to be honest with him and hopefully he will take care of his responsibilities .
You said your Mum knows ?
Well break the news with her by your side then , hopefully your boyfriend wo n't get violent or anything .
Give him time to digest the information .
It will come as a shock , particularly if you thought you 'd played it safe .
I know you said you did n't think you could have an abortion , but it 's important to talk things through with him and decide what 's best to do for both of you and , most importantly , for the baby .
Yeah I 'll tell you guys tomorrow I 'm just afraid as he 's prone to act violent at times .
+ He told me to take the pill and I did n't and he 's gonna be like ' WTF There 's no way I can support a child at 19 and that you should n't be having a kid as you 're not even 18 yet blah blah blah ' ...
So I 'll just tell him he does n't have to be involved with our child financially and I just want him to be there for it as a fatherly figure ( which I doubt he can commit to ) as my Parents can support us anyways .
This is going to sound harsh and I understand it is your body , but I am going to be brutally honest .
Get an abortion .
Firstly , you may want to keep it , but think about it in the long run .
What kind of life will the baby live ?
You are still a kid yourself , around 16/17 I would assume .
I doubt you will be able to give it a good life .
Also your boyfriend .
I doubt he will be happy and most of the time , boys in this situation will bail .
He is 19 , I doubt he has any long term plans to stay with you .
By keeping the baby you are pretty much being selfish .
Yeah its your body , but there are 2 people you need to think about :
1. The baby . I can almost guarantee you will not be able to give the baby a good life because of how young you are , and I doubt the father will stay .
2. Your boyfreind . He is 19 , you are dragging him down for life at such a young age by keeping it .
Actually 3 people .
Yourself . You may end up regretting it in the long run .
Having a baby is a huge responsibility .
This is children having children .
Do everyone a favor and have an abortion .
Harsh but true .
You will just end up adding to the long and miserable statistic .
EDIT : Cant believe I was actually negged for this . Truth * * * * ing hurts .
I 'm confused , i love him or i thought i did so why am i turned off him now ?
He admitted to me that he is bisexual we were talking about ex 's and he told me about one ex who is another guy .
I was shocked and asked him why he did n't tell me before , he said he did n't see a reason to tell me because he liked me a lot .
He should have told me , i 'm turned off at the thought of him with other guys and being sexually attracted to another guy .
Will this feeling go away or shall i break up ?
Do n't feel guilty for feeling like that .
Nothing wrong with being bi , but just as bi 's have a taste for guys and girls , some people do n't have a taste for bi 's , if you know what I mean ?
If you 're really into him stick around , maybe it 's just the shock that 's making you feel this way .
Maybe wait a few days and see how the news settles with you before making a decision ?
Everyone has a past , to judge him on his would be unfair if you love him .
But if it turns you off or you ca n't come to terms with it then its probably best to break it off .
Either way , give yourself a few days to think about it first if you 're not sure .
I 've suffered with excess body hair since I was young , and I was bullied because of it through primary / secondary school and now am unable to wear tshirts etc in public because of how paranoid I am about it .
I went to the doctors because of it when I was around 11 , and they did a blood test but it came back normal so I assume I do n't have PCOS .
I have very hairy arms for a girl , not thick hairs like a males but lots of very noticable , dark and long ( I bleach regularly but it only lasts a day or two before the roots are noticable ) .
I have never shaved them because I shave my legs and get terrible ingrown hairs , even though I moisturise / exfoliate etc.
I 've tried waxing but it only lasted 2 days before the hairs began to grow back , so it 's really not worth it .
Anyway I checked out reviews and after shopping around I decided to get the GBP 350 Boots Smooth Skin Plus Intense Pulsed Light permanent hair reduction machine .
The reviews were on the whole very good , it comes with 20,000 flashes ( it takes between 70-100 flashes to do my arms each time I think ) and you need applicator gel which is GBP 3 .
It appears to do exactly the same thing as you would get in a laser clinic , but cheaper and means I will be able to target any missed hairs you might get going to a clinic and it 's obviously private / convenient .
The sales assistant in Boots was very helpful , and assured me I could get a no - quibble refund if I find it does n't work but she assured me it will .
I 'm going to use it on my arms first of all , because this is the area that affects me the most confidence wise , but will gradually move on to other areas .
For permanent hair reduction I will need to use the machine once a week for between 6-12 weeks ( although I will probably need 12 weeks ! ) and will start using it tonight .
I 'm quite sceptical over whether it will work but because I 'm confident I can return it , I think it was worth the risk .
I know other girls on here have the same issue with excess body hair , so will monitor the hair reduction over the 12 weeks course to let you know how it goes incase anyone else is thinking of buying one
Week 1 : Shaved my arms and zapped them today , did it in two separate goes ( took around 30 mins to do each arm ) and my sister did them for me just because certain angles are tricky to get to .
On a pain scale I 'd give it 2/10 ( just feels like a hot , tingling sensation for about 1 second then fades ) .
Will update what the regrowth is like next Saturday .
Week 2 : Had to shave my arms again last night all over , hair regrowth not as course or fast as expected but still widespread .
Just finished zapping them again but this time did it myself , found it to be much quicker .
I was thinking of buying one of these because I just think it would be the best thing ever to never have to shave my bikini area again !
Let us know how you get on !
If this works well I would definitely buy one , I hate shaving and my arms are quite hairy as well ( I do n't shave or bleach them but I am self conscious ) , so I 'd love to be hair free forever .
Please let us know how you get on
Thanks for doing this , OP.
I 've been debating whether to get one of these machines too .
I really hope it works for you .
I hope it works too !
I suffer from excess body hair and would love for a machine that could get rid of it !
Is there any way you can use this kind of thing on your face ?
I assume goggles would be necessary but it would be really nice if it were possible .
I have been looking both at this and the Phillips Lumea , which is a little more expensive , but I keep thinking it 's too much of an expense for something that I 'm not 100 % sure will work .
Looking forward to hearing what your results are like for this , as I 'd love to be able to buy something that would mean I would n't have to shave every two days in the summer !
Without any cosmetic enhancements .
Tips ? hints ?
In an ideal world I 'd like to hit a 8/10 .
I ask this because I want to start ' mingling ' .
I 'd like to look like ' something special ' for once .
Styling your hair and cloth helps a lot .
A bit of make - up , almost every girl wears make - up .
Some nice accessories would help too .
Dye your hair a ridic colour .
Wear really weird earrings .
Wear clashing colours !
Bright red ( or orange , or any colour , if you 're confident enough ) lippy .
Im really pale and sick of using fake tan ... coming out patchy and smelling like curry is awful !
I have loads of freckles over my body so it doesnt even look nice natural !
I wanted to start using sunbeds ... not to often but just to build a nice natural tan !
But when i go on holiday i burn really easily so i was wondering whether i would burn if i went on the sunbeds or if i built it up it would be gradually get my skin to go tanned ?
Do n't use sunbeds .
Pale freckly skin is lovely , and sunbeds are really dangerous and just not good for you .
Sunbeds are very dangerous , especially with regular use and for people with naturally pale complexions , and you say you have ' freckles ' all over your body .
Some of these may be moles and so it 's just not safe .
Invest in a proffessional fake spray tan - there are more and more salons .
Or just be pale and beautiful as I am
I am so confused and annoyed !
My mac nc55 studio fix fluid was perfect for my face a couple of months ago but now my face looks dull and ... muddy / ashy ?
Also my face and chest had a ridiculous colour difference .
I googled nc45 just now and the girls actually look around my skin tone : /
Is it possible to go from nc55 to nc45 ?
My problem is where I should match my foundation to .
My face is medium , my neck slightly darker and my chest so pale ( compare to face and arms ) it 's unbelieveable .
I would actually call my chest an nc 44 .
So what do I do ?
I feel I would look ghostly if I used nc45 but then my chest and face would be the same , help !
Yes I have to different MAC foundations because my skin changes all the time .
I would suggest going to the counter and asking them to match you again .
Someone said that NW 30/35 is meant to be a good shade for ( brown / black ) people who find themselves changing shades
If you matched it to your chest would n't your neck look weird though ?
I would always say to match to your face as your natural colouring will always suit you best .
I 'm very pale caucasian and my chest is darker than my face , if I were to match to my chest I 'd just look a bit mucky , like I had n't washed in weeks , and I think that if your foundation does n't completely blend into your natural skintone along your jawline you can look like you 're wearing a mask .
I recommend getting colour matched to your jawline and then adjust with bronzers / highlighters .
I got my nose pierced a couple of weeks ago with a stud .
It 's not a bone so it is literally just a stud , similar to earrings .
Because of this is falls out all the time as theres nothing inside to keep it in place .
I want to change to an L - shaped stud , but i 'm worried it wo n't go in easily because i 've had it pierced with a straight stud .
Any advice ?
Why the hell did they pierce you with a straight stud ?
Go back to the piercer and ask for it to be changed or find a piercer who will , they should be able to swap it without any fuss .
I had mine pierced with a straight stud , it was flipping awkward .
Do n't do what I did though , and change it before the 6 weeks or whatever , as you will probably get an infection which comes up as a nasty wart thing on your nose . D :
The L - shaped studs are different to put in to the straight ones , but if you get the technique right , once you do it correctly , you can do it again .
You put the first bit of the L shape in the hole , making sure you can feel the tip of the end on the inside of your nose .
Then press firmly , twisting slightly upwards and it should slide in .
If you still have troubles , just go see the piercer and they 'll put it in for you
I noticed i was getting these permanent forehead lines and that my face was a bit dry .
I decided to use some moisturizer and its helped .
Do many other guys choose to moisturize ?
I use clarins for men :-)
The daily wash on my face , the exfoliating scrub twice a week , and the anti - shine moisturiser on a daily basis ( at least ) .
I have tried the cheaper brands , loreal and nivea , and I think they make my skin feel worse .
I use cheap generic moisturiser after shaving because my skin gets dry and sometimes tender after shaving .
I only do it after a shave because otherwise the facial hair stops it from melting into the skin properly .
Any moisturiser labelled as ' aftershave balm ' or ' aftershave lotion ' or ' for men ' etc. is just a big rip off .
It is exactly the same stuff as cheap moisturiser but it is marketed towards meathead guys who think that moisturiser is ' liek so gay ' .
Nivea aftershave lotion is around GBP 3-5 for a tiny 100ml bottle wheras you can get a big 500ml bottle of generic stuff for about a pound that has exactly the same effect .
This is just the modern day version of the old ' mansize tissues ' marketing one - two .
" Oh , it has the word ' man ' in it so it is n't gay anymore "
I had grade 2 acne and it was particularly bad when I ' overwashed ' so I was compelled to wash less and to start moisturising ( Nivea : Dry Skin , after washing or shaving ) in my late teens .
I also use moisturising shower gel or I get BACNE , nice
Result is my skin is smoother than it is on some teenage girls ! -
goes down well with the ladies and I look a LOT younger than my years , though that 's probably more to do with genetics eh
Anyone else get one ?
I was very impressed after last months Batiste fiasco ...
I got the Ciate Nail polish in Kitten Heels Ilamasqua Sheer lipgloss in Explode Nouveau strip lashes Weleda Pomegranate Regenerating Body Oil and Xen - Tan Deep bronze luxe .
What did you all think !
I think that is well worth GBP 10 .
Sounds good .
I like the idea of the glossy box and was going to sign up a couple of months ago . But I am worried incase I end up with a load of stuff I just wont use .
The Xen Tan sounds good !
I want to sign up but I 'm worried I 'll get a load of rubbish too : /
I tried to order a maxi dress online last night from Jane Norman , but when I entered my details , I was told the order had n't gone through .
So I tried inputting my details twice more , to no avail ....
So imagine my horror to see that I 'd been charged three times for an item that had n't gone through ? !
Has anyone been in a similar situation ?
If so , how did you resolve it ?
Any help would be appreciated
I read here somewhere that Jane Norman had gone bust ?
I do n't know if they are just closing the stores or both but I think you should see if they have a number you can call .
I would also call your bank .
I just shaved all my hair off and I 'm feeling good .
I think I might buy a lace front wig tomorrow though .
My hair was badly damaged , it 's something that had to be done , it feels so weird .
I 've always wanted to do this but never had the courage .
Congratulations !
I too would buy a lace front wig if I did it but they 're so damn expensive and time consuming to put on .
I do not know whether to buy a foundation primer - they are very expensive , being almost the same price as the foundation ( for example laura mercier foundation primer ) .
Are they actually worth it ?
Do they make a real difference to your skin , or is it just a marketing ploy ?
Does anyone have any they would recommend ?
Thank you in advance !
They 're definitely worth it , but I do n't wear a primer every day so I suppose I 'm willing to pay a bit more for them .
I only really wear a primer if I 'm going out .
Depends what your skin is like , really .
As a general rule , if your skin is n't totally perfect , or if it 's a bit oily , then a primer is going to make your foundation last a lot longer and look a lot better .
I never used to use it , but in the last few weeks I 've really seen a difference .
Would you get , or do you know anybody who has gotten a Harry Potter tattoo anywhere on their body ?
If you 're confused ( though I ca n't see why you would be ) this is what I am talking about
and there are many , many more ...
Now , I am as much of a HP fan - geek as the next person , but I would never dream of getting a huge HP montage on my body .
Imo , while I do love HP and have grown up with it etc. etc. , I know when I am 40 + years old I will look back upon the tattoo and wonder what made me decide to get it .
I can understand why people would want to get it done - it 's declaration of their love for HP and stuff , but I personally would n't ever get a Harry Potter tattoo .
Some small quotes / symbols do n't look too bad , but that 's just because I can appreciate the sentiments behind it .
But , while I think they do look pretty cool on other people , I know it is just a phase for me and that 's why I would never have it done .
Any thought or opinions ?
Has anyone actually had one done or is thinking about getting one done ?
It 's your body , up to you what you put on it .
Sure you will get some funny looks and people will judge you .
Kind of like those Twighlight tattoo 's middle aged women get , I find that more disturbing than young people getting HP tattoo 's - they will probably look back when they are 30/40/50 and remember their childhood .
Yet these people who get the tattoo 's aged 30 + already .... that 's another story .
Yeah , I mean , it 's one thing to proclaim yourself as a fan of Harry Potter , and another thing entirely to parade around as poster for it
Tbh , most of what people get is just for the sake of getting a HP tattoo , not necessarily because of the meaning or symbolism behind it ...
Never .. They do realise that in 50 + years time , they 're still going to have " Expecto Patronum " tattooed on them .. ?
Imagine trying to explain that to your children / grandchildren " Yes , I did get a tattoo of something from a fiction book ... "
I would never get it myself , but I would definitely love to meet a person who would and be their friend lol .... devotion to the next level
I wonder how outdated we will think Harry Potter is 50 years time
So after wearing glasses for about 10 years now , I think its finally time to get contacts .
I would seriously appreciate some advise from people who use contacts already plz !!
So there are these asda ones which seem to be quite cheap :
and in contrast there are these ones that they sell @ vision express :
^ ^ ^ are almost double the price .
So my questions are :
a ) Mite sound a bit stupid but would my vision be better with the more expensive ones ?
b ) Are the daily ones better than the weeklies ( as they are cheaper )
c ) Say if i do get weeklies / monthlies , can i sleep / go to the shower with them ?
d ) Finaly , which shop / website do you recommend and some buying advise would be realy good plz !!
I 'd recommend going to your optician first , you need to know your exact prescription , and whether anything else needs to be looked at , e.g. astigmatism , whether you 'd suit wet ones or drier lenses .
I prefer the daily ones , as there 's no hassle of cleaning and storing them .
You can shower in lenses , but I would n't recommend sleeping in them .
I 've done it a couple of times by accident , and I woke up in pain because they 'd moved around back and sort of folded over under my eyelid .
I personally would n't go for the cheapest ones .
My eyes and my teeth are the only thing I do n't skimp on , because it 's so ridiculously expensive when things go wrong with them that it 's just better to take very good care of them from the start .
Hi all , Essentially , I 'm looking for a " cover - up " ( for lack of a better word ) I can wear daily .
I was wondering is primer alone suitable for this ?
The thing is I do n't like to wear foundation AT ALL ( my face feels weird ) .
With regards to tinted moisturiser , I have Benefit 's tinted moisturiser - it 's okay but I prefer to use it for night 's out or special events .
Somehow it still feels heavy on my face .
Is there a much lighter tined moisturiser out there ?
Any advice or tips for what would be suitable for me to wear and brands ?
I 'd prefer to keep away from foundation if possible .
Thank you !
I know what you said about foundation , but try Body Shop .
it 's really light , then use a powder brush to put a LIGHT dusting of a pressed powder .
if you 're just looking for a blemish cover , rimmel do a blemish stick which covers a multitude of sins .
Make sure you remove any make up with a good non greasy cleanser if you do n't want pizza face
Primer does n't usually give any coverage .
Tinted moisturiser gives a little , but imo does n't do much at all and I do n't like the feel and texture on my skin .
I used a Stila one as it was ok , but slightly greasy
I 'd just get a really light foundation e.g. Givenchy
Do you remember that movie that was based on Nothern Lights by Philip Pullman ?
How come they never made a sequal ?
I was shocked .. there was so much hype when it came out ... it was so anticipated ... x
Well in the series of Philip Pullman books , the next one in the sequence is called The Subtle Knife , I guess they would make a film of that rather than calling it The Golden Compass 2 .
I imagine they would n't make a sequel because the first film was n't very good .
If they even think of calling it " The Golden Compass 2 " , I will go into Genocide Mode .
It pissed me off enough that they change Northern Lights to The Golden Compass for no apparent reason as it is , let alone * * * * ing up the rest of the trilogy .
The film sold well in Europe but poorly in America , as a lot of religious groups saw the film as anti - christian / religion and so it got a lot of bad press .
The American market is what matters ( afterall , they took the american title of the book , not the original title ) , so all plans for a sequel were canned .
Not to mention that The Golden Compass stripped off all the references to religion it possibly could , but that 's pretty much impossible in the sequels .
How can you kill God without any religious context ?
So if there was bad press for the first film it 'd only get a million times worse by the time the last film came out .
To many fans it 's difficult to see how The Golden Compass could 've even carried the series forward since it left out a lot of the important parts of the Magesterium that is developed in the sequels .
In short , if there is ever to be a Dark Materials Trilogy , it 'll have to be from a British film production company who do n't care what the Bible Belt thinks .
It would 've been nice if someone decided to take it on after the Harry Potter film craze dies down , but since it 's been tried once and failed I think it 's going to be a good few years ( 10 or so ? ) before anyone thinks of touching it again .
Hopefully if it happens they 'll do a Lord of the Rings and film it in one big go rather than wait to see if the box office figures validate a sequel . : /
I do n't either but I can see why he 's doing it .
Cameron is re - releasing Avatar with 6 additional minutes of footage .
People might think it 's a waste of effort , but those 6 minutes will no doubt bring him at least , a few more million $ $ $ in the bank , just like this 3D crap will for Lucas .
Depends on the film , I thought it was interesting to see Avatar in 3D , but no other movie since has interested me in 3D ( Harry Potter in 3D is a joke )
On the subject of Star Wars , as a massive fan since I was a child this saddens me as I would like the films to be left as they are . ( Saying that I do agreed with the remastering they did for the 20th anniversary ... )
Though being the whore that I am. .. I will probably splash the cash to watch Star Wars on the big screen again ...
Hollywood money - grabber cashes in while contributing to destroying new technology - shocker .
I also disagree with people who would say " why not ? " .
Artistic integrity , for instance .
It would be far more appealing to see those films fully remastered in IMAX , rather than a tacky bandwagon jump , and it would still rake in money .
The problem is " good " is still a long way off the kind of images audiences expect .
Without the Force , an after - conversion will never even begin to look good .
If you had six films , which were n't released in their in - universe chronological order originally , would n't you want to change it for any subsequent release ?
The prequels would definitely be improved with 3D , because like Avatar they 're all about spectacle and explosions and the " plot " is really just there to string the spectacle and explosions along for 2 hours .
You ca n't tell me you would n't want to see , say , the opening battle in ROTS in 3D ?
That was awesome enough in the cinema anyway , but it could really be enhanced by ILM doing their thang .
I am less optimistic about the core films being convincing in 3D , because as much as I love their visual effects , they were designed 20 years before people even began talking about the possibility of 3D as it has been realised today .
They have held up very well because the story and characters are strong , not because the visual effects are up to much , revolutionary though they were at the time .
Still , this is ILM we 're talking about here , hopefully all six films will come out looking pretty good .
However what I really want is a Blu - ray collection of all six .
Hurry the * * * * up , George .
Has anyone heard of this film ?
It stars , among others , Natalie Portman , Vincent Cassel , Winona Ryder and Mila Kunis .
It has received some amazing reviews .
It is going to be officially released here in the UK next year in February , but it is going to be shown at the London Film Festival next month .
I read the screenplay a while ago .
A lot of visual potential but a little weak in the storytelling department .
Hopefully Aronofsky has been able to turn it around , though I 'm not really digging the trailer - Mulholland Drive anyone ?
It has Mila Kunis kissing Natalie Portman in one scene .
It 's safe to say the film will attract viewers .
id played a video game called the prince of persia but there is already a film coming out .
For those , who have watched it . what is the feedbacks ?
Planning to see the movie alone
I think it looks AWFUL , personally .
I really ca n't stand that actress because she plays the most annoying characters ever , and her character in Prince of Persia really grates in just the trailers .
Not to mention that the script sounds horrendous .
I have n't seen it though ...
I was gonna ask if I was the only one who thought this , but a quick Google search of ' Sex and the City 2 racist ' answers that question .
Was the film racist ?
Was it intentional , to add to the vapid ignorance of the characters ?
Was it intentional pro - American propaganda ?
Or am I , and many critics , making something out of nothing ?
Thoughts TSR ?
It was kinda insulting to their culture .
But the whole thing was exaggerated for the purpose of enhancing the storyline , e.g the clash between samantha 's rampant sexuality and the " cover up " stereotype of eastern countries .
I do n't think anybody should get on their high horse about it , people only insult it because it 's sex and the city , nobody gives a * * * * about stuff like that in other films .
I was watching good will hunting and I realised how some of the things in the film apply to me eg pushing yourself away from people because you 're scared that they 'll find you imperfections etc.
That really got me thinking about my life and what i need to change so if you have any films that have changed you personally or have made you change your outlook on life then plz share .
If you 're thinking , think about something useful and interesting which will get you somewhere : maths .
I agree there 's more than education .
If you do n't want to think , you could get wasted or do something else etc.
If you 're spending your time thinking , make it useful thinking , that 's all I 'm saying .
The Doom Generation . Saw 1 , i know a lot of people got hooked up on the gore and ' sickness ' of it , but the whole point of that film was philosophy about life and it did get me thinking for a while .
Actually it led to a lengthy , involved discussion at uni in which someone ended up crying . So definitely good for thinking about life .
And if you 're willing to watch something that is n't a film but still goes in the DVD player , then any of the Bill Hicks stuff
If anyone has n't said The Blind Side yet , then that gets my vote !
I saw the trailer for it and have yet to see the whole thing , but it looks amazing .
And I do n't necessarily think this film is going to make you think hard about life , but .. I also recommend watching Brick .
It 's good if you 're into a film noir kinda thing .
Cant believe no - one has mentioned Pursuit of Happyness , the only time I have shed a tear infront of the TV since seeing Tottenham loose the Worthington Cup Final when I was 9 .
Serious stuff , this movie is immense and has affected me more then any other film or tv show .
Scrubs is pretty good as well as providing laugh .
I dont know if you genuinely believe this or if you are just trying to act the adult .
A life having been spent entirely on academia whether it be maths or anthropology at the cost of missing essential human experiences is the biggest waste of a life imaginable .
Did anyone know ?
IMDB page
The film is classed comedy - drama and is supposedly about the creators and the founding of Facebook .
Facebook has been around for five years now and the question is , does it warrant a film ?
Are the makers hoping every Facebook user . around 200million globally will watch the film ?
Bit of a stupid idea how film production companies will make a movie about this when there a far better movie scripts out there .
Why not make a film about Digg ?
That 's got a better founding story than Facebook .
Why is Justin Timberlake in it ?
Are they just trying anything to make it big ?
I personally use Facebook and think it 's a useful thing to have , but to be honest why would I want to see a film about it ?
I like seeing comedies , or thrillers , or action films .. but a film about the founders of Facebook ?
Yeah I heard about that about a year ago when it first went into production .
I 'm really interested to see what comes of it given the cast and ( especially ) David Fincher directing with Aaron Sorkin scripting !!!
The Academy has announced that they will permit ten nominees for the Best Film category instead of the usual five .
The reason behind the change is that the Academy , in the face of falling ratings , wants to attract more popularity to the Oscars .
What do you think of this change ?
What would you do to make the Oscars more popular ?
Or do you think the rise of the internet and etc will inevitably slowly kill off the oscars ?
I 'm still fuming about Shawshank not getting an Oscar .
Similarly , I am still pissed that Slumdog Millionaire was awarded Best Film last year .
It is a travesty !
It was good no doubt , but the best ?
The judging panel just jumped on the bangwagon surrounding the media hype .
I think The Dark Knight should have won the Best Film award , but they did n't even nominate that film .
Out of the nominated ones , I think Milk was much better than Slumdog Millionaire .
Though Frost / Nixon was pretty good as well .
( The Reader and the Benjamin Button films were crap . )
So in the last week , the new head of Ofsted , Sir Michael Wilshaw , has said : " All teachers should be qualified " .
What an absolutely preposterous suggestion !
You mean to say that , as citizens of this great nation , our children should be taught by professional people who have gone through the necessary rigmarole to be let loose in our schools ?
How dare we expect that from our education system . And while we 're at it - why stop there ?
Let 's round up our homeless and get them working in our hospitals .
It 'll get them off the streets and straight into promising careers .
Youth unemployment is rife at the moment so let 's get them piloting our aeroplanes .
Heathrow might even get its third runway so we could do with a few more pilots .
I heard overcrowding in jails is a problem too - especially since the rioting last summer .
Why do n't we just convert the miscreants to our side by giving them a uniform and a gun ?
They 're bound to see sense and start making our streets safer instead of causing the trouble .
And lastly , with the Easter holidays coming up , young children will need something to keep them occupied .
Maybe they can try writing for a Sunday tabloid - I hear there are vacancies at The Sun.
You may have sensed my slight sarcastic undertones - although that last suggestion might not be such a bad idea .
Call me naive , but I always assumed that teachers were either qualified or training alongside someone qualified ?
It seems though that any old sod can do it .
Is it any wonder then that the UK 's position in the international league tables has slipped ?
So despite sounding incredibly obvious , Mr Wilshaw seems to have hit the nail on the head .
Problem solved .
I 'm sure it comes as a welcome suggestion to all the fully trained , out - of - work teachers who struggle to get a job .
Not to mention the ones who have jobs and have worked extremely hard to get there .
So until then - if you 're passing by your child 's school , you might want to pop your head around the classroom door .
Just to make sure one of the dinner ladies is n't also teaching maths .
All teachers should be able to teach .
Some piece of paper from a teaching academy does not equate to , by definition , being capable of teaching .
I think all we need to do is think of some teachers we have had to know this .
And at the same time I think we can all think of great teachers who have not had a piece of paper from a teacher training college .
With this notion of qualifications there is an unholy alliance of two groups of people .
The first is the well intended sponsors who think enforcing such rules will improve education by keeping so called unqualified teachers out .
The second is the special interest group , the teachers unions , who want to keep competition out so they want a piece of paper that teachers need to have .
This piece of paper is just another barrier to entry for outsiders and keeps the incumbent teachers safer from competition .
The teachers unions hate competition and they have done a very good job of fending off competition under the guise of the public interest
Fortunately we have things like the Khan Academy now that are going to seriously screw those monopolistic selfish bastards over .
Suck on that educational establishment .
This is a story about BNP on DM
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti....html#comments
Unsurprisingly the most liked comments defend the BNP , the rest all praise the BNP , whether it be in a stealthy way or openly ( most of the " best rated " comments openly support the BNP ) .
Majority of the " worst rated " comments on that site criticise the BNP .
I conclude that most of the readers of that paper are BNP sympathisers or supporters .
p.s i would have been for the BNP if they just were n't racist or presented themselves as a " Christian party which support Christian values " , some of their policies e.g " get out of Afghanistan " , " stop being USA 's poodle " , " kick out muslims who dont integrate " , " eradicate Islamic fundamentalism from britian " e.t.c really interest me .
I wish liberals supported the policies i mentioned
While I too think most of their readers are racist , I think for the majority they are more " friendly " racists than " BNP " racists .
By friendly I mean that while they harbour racist views , they are perfectly polite to anyone of any race and do n't go around being openly racist or discriminate against individuals .
Still not a great quality to have , but nowhere near the level of vitriole as the BNP .
I would n't compare them directly to the BNP - most of the readers are white middle class people who find many of the changes in society scary and the Daily Mail gives them stereotypes to blame without using too complicated language .
Whilst it 's an awful paper , comparing its entire readership to some of the monsters in the BNP party is wrong .
Please post in this thread all discussion relating to the recent rise in tension between the UK and Argentina over the issue of the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands .
Argentina is growing quite rapidly compared to the UK , but that is beside the point .
If Argentina were to launch a surprise attack and take the island 's airfields , then Britain would be effectively unable to retaliate due to lack of an aircraft carrier .
Keep pretending everything is fine , though .
Argentina - yes .
Argentina 's armed forces - no.
Argentina launch a surprise attack ?
Well , it would certainly be surprising , not least to the members of their armed forces using the same kit they did in '82 .
They 'd be astonished to learn that they had suddenly discovered the requisite experience , training and equipment to make such a landing possible .
Not to mention we have the southern hemisphere 's most capable attack aircraft stationed on the FIs .
Yes , we 're without an aircraft carrier , meaning we can not retaliate in the same way we did in '82 .
However , this does not mean we can not retaliate .
We 've proven that the Typhoon can fly from Ascension Island to the Falklands .
The RN can still launch a task force that would , if allowed to fight openly , utterly decimate the Argentinian Navy and we retain the ability to launch Tomahawks directly through Ms. Kirchner 's window should we wish .
They would have to be suicidal .
Pretty cool eh ?
What do people think about In - Vitro meat ?
Would you eat it ?
As a matter of interest to the vegetarians and vegans out there , if it was n't mixed with blood , and was simply stem - cell grown , would you eat it
( I can see why vegans might be opposed , but I 'm unsure about vegetarians )
If it benefited my health then I would probably eat it .
Sounds interesting . Though I doubt they 'll be able to replicate the taste of a good bit of beef any time soon .
For fast food places where the meat they use is terrible anyway it should n't affect things much .
It might be the key to the survival of the human race .
How do vegetarians view this ?
All the things they could research to do with stem cells and they come up with this ?
Time is running out for the Chagos Islanders to return home .
These people were illegally removed from their homeland to make way for the US military base on Diego Garcia , leased to the US from the UK for a 50 year period , which could be renewed for a further 20 years in 2016 , if the US so wish .
I 'd urge anyone to watch this video for deeper understanding of this atrocity : - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oCqqn_uOiY
If you are short of time please take a few minutes to watch this : - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFLhB_SkMIg
After witnessing these events , I hope us educated TSRians have the view that democracy should prevail , and no one should be forcibly removed from their homes .
Not many know about these atrocities , but help spread the word .
And PLEASE sign this petition to raise awareness , and hopefully ( yes , being very hopeful here ) it will one day be debated in the House of Commons . http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/4685
Thank you .
I signed it .
With all the stuff going with the Falklands , I think this makes the UK seem a bit hypocritical .
I 'll sign the petition if you remove the highlighted part from your post .
It 's inflammatory and a cheap attack on coalition forces .
When actual innocent civilians do die it 's regretable , but we both know that they are n't the intended target .
You clearly put that there to win brownie points with the anti - war crowd despite this issue having nothing at all to do with the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and infact bomber operations out of Diego Garcia completely ceased over five years ago .
I happened to watch a news review on Sky News this morning in which a bunch of journo 's were bleating on that we should n't condemn all the " innocent " and hard working journalists at News International just because a whole bunch of hacks at the Sun were arrested ...
because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry .
Oh poor them .
This is precsisely , is it not ? , what the whole media has been doing to the banking industry for the last two years or so ?
Total hypocrisy .
It is important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industries but it 's ironic that the papers have been selling copy by basically tarring all bankers with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for years .
Isnt Sky News owned by BSkyB which is owned by News international or something ?
It doesnt surprise me though , lets hope Murdoch goes down .
The media condemning bankers is akin to a witch hunt , Stephen Hester was given just a GBP 6. 5M bonus in 2010 yet JPMorgan 's top executive was paid $ 21M that year .
Stephen Hester was employed because of his excellent show of skills after his success in safely defusing the explosive capital - market business of Abbey National .
The media seem to have mixed up the man responsible for the merge with ABN Amro with the man responsible for fixing the failure of RBS .
Moral of the story : the media will always present news in a way which forwards their views , it 's that simple .
I recently came across two stories , one about a PCSO in the UK who was arrested and sentenced to up to 10 years for having an " affair " with a 12 year old girl , and another where a woman in Utah was given up to 15 years for having sex with a 14 year old boy .
For the sake of argument , lets say a 35 year old woman was having sex with a 14 year old boy and similarly a 35 year old man was having sex with a 14 year old girl .
I ca n't think of a good reason why either of these scenarios should be worse than the other , but deep down i seem to feel that the first scenario is n't that serious at all .
In order to give a reason as to why they are different i 'd have to admit a difference in free will between young guys and girls , which is hard to do .
But for some reason it almost seems like the 35 year old man is some sort of predator whereas the 35 year old woman is only misguided .
In keeping with this the 14 year old girl was taken advantage of whereas the 14 year old boy was lucky .
Note that in both cases the sex was consensual , obviously not legally , but in the sense that there was n't any physical compulsion .
So i 'm not saying if a 14 year boy was forcibly touched by a woman it would be ok .
I had a discussion about this with my girlfriend , she thinks both are serious .
I agree , but also seem to have this almost sexist view that the boy was really hurt at all .
What do you guys think ?
Is it sexism or is sex between teenage boys and older woman just fundamentally different ?
I think it seems less serious because 14 - year - old boys talk about having sex with an " older woman " as if it were an achievement .
Whereas to a 14 - year - old girl , if an older man was interested in her she 'd consider him a dirty pervert .
Therefore it seems unlikely that the girl consented , whereas most would believe the boy would be very much up for it .
Well suppose the 14 year old girl felt the guy loved her and wanted to have sex with him .
It still seems that it 's worse because for some reason i 'd think the man had manipulated her in some way whereas in the other case i would n't really feel the boy had been duped .
I think this is n't a good way to think about it but it seems fairly prevalent .
Yes , I saw that .
My point is , people would n't believe that . That 's why it seems worse .
Girl : " But i wanted sex with him ! " - most would assume she was brainwashed , groomed .
Boy : " But I wanted sex with her ! " - most would assume that yes , he probably did .
Anyone else think it 's a bit ridiculous that this man actually got arrested for making a monkey gesture ?
It did n't hurt anyone , and whilst it may be offensive to some , surely this is n't an arrestable offence ?
I mean , where 's the line between Un - PC and Illegal ?
No , I do n't think it was ridiculous .
Whilst no one wants to stop banter , the intention of this was clear : to cause offence .
It was disgraceful and totally unacceptable .
Criminal charges + lifetime ban from all grounds methinks .
I 'm a Liverpool fan and there can be no excuse for this behaviour .
I hope he is banned from football for life ( not just Anfield ) .
I honestly do n't understand racist people .
No he should have been arrested .
I hope the FA ban him from all matches for life , and the courts give him a suspended sentence and some kind of community service .
What I do n't understand is in the film Hot Fuzz , one of the detectives , who was white , called Nick Frost , who is also white , a monkey .
Now , unless I 'm missing something here , I 'm pretty sure Nick Frost is n't black , and monkey means black person , does n't it ?
So what was this detective using the word ' monkey ' for if it was n't to mean black person ?
I 'm terribly confused .
it 's short but if you do n't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a " 14 year old girl " who was actually an undercover cop ...
surely this is entrapment ?
he did n't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation ?
sure , it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up ...
but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it , feeding him along ?
this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything ...
coaxed him into it ...
we do n't know the full story but i get the impression that this " 14 year old girl " offered him sex on a plate willingly ....
would that be legal in this country ?
i mean i think it 's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex ...
but fabricating the situation ... you ca n't arrest someone for something they have n't done ... it 's just wrong ...
am i the only one who thinks this is messed up ?
From previous similar stories , what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive ( as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be ) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile , if he shows up at the place then he is guilty .
I see nothing wrong with this morally , he knows the girl is 14 and still decides to meet her ( having previously stated his intentions through IM ) .
if that is the case then i understand and agree , it 's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work , and it 's in america so different laws to here .
They do this and it works , there is even a show about it .
To me its fine , if the suspect has to make a choice , ie leave his home and go to a location , then I do n't really care if he is encouraged .
Not that recent but it has gone under the radar for months .
It 's graphic so that is why it is in spoilers .
Strange that youtube keeps it up , but it 's not horrifically graphic like things on liveleak .
Story is basically that they were targeted for refusing to believe in God / Jesus as their saviour .
Guess they did n't get the versions with the execution parts edited out ?
inb4 " you ca n't judge all Christians on a remote village in kenya "
I 'm not , I 'm just posting it .
What planet are you on ?
Go to the gore websites that dont restrict content and you 'll get so many things about Africa .
The majority of the world may be in the 21st century but that crap hole is still in the dark ages .
There 's nothing to stop these people what they 're doing , either .
I imagine the town is either under the grip of religion , or too scared to protest simply because of the nature of these punishments .
Another bullet point on the big list of things atheists did n't do .
How Christian of them !
It would be a bit silly to suggest only Christians have done things like this .
What do we think ?
Will this mean a weaker United Kingdom ?
Something that struck me watching a question time debate on this issue was the attitude of some English people , such as the obnoxious Mail journalist on the panel , that Scottish independence was good because then we would n't have to subsidise them for being poor .
He even made some kind of play on words involving the word " skint " .
Scotland probably receives more than its fair share of UK government spending in terms of its share of the population .
I believe this is because it is , on average , poorer than England .
The way some English people sneer at the Scots for being poor and therefore receiving more government spending would n't , I presume , be directed at poor areas of England .
The north , Wales , the south - west , east London and many other areas of the UK get more than their proportional share of spending , because they need it .
I think it 's wrong to resent the Scottish poor for being Scottish , because I 'm sure such complaints would n't be made about poor regions of England .
I was also annoyed by a woman in the audience who said Scotland should be independent ( she was English ) because " all countries should be independent " , including Wales and " Ireland " .
This is such a simplistic view .
Should Yorkshire be independent ?
Should Flanders split from French - speaking Belgium ?
Should Northern Ireland join with the Republic ?
Should Quebec be independent ?
Should the Kurds be independent ?
Should Bavarian , or Basque , or Sicilian , or Catalan , or Bosnian - Serbs , or Cantonese Chinese have independence ?
Loads of places have their own histories , cultures , devolved governments , languages and so on .
Just because Scotland was an independent state 300 years ago , does n't mean it should be today .
The definition of " country " is more complex than that woman 's personal black and white judgements .
Culturally I feel British and I want Britain to stay together .
But I recognise there are convincing political and economic reasons the SNP have for independence and I do n't think Lord Ashdown 's reponse on QT of " we 're stronger together " had enough real substance to it .
I support him , but Unionists need to express in more real terms why we 're stronger together .
Another interesting issue is the advantage to the Tories if Labour - dominated Scotland breaks away .
The Mail guy made this point and Dimbleby immediately quoted numbers prooving that actually Scottish MPs have never been significant in the balance of power in the Commons .
( Take that sensationalist journalist who has n't got their facts straight ! )
And then there 's the issue of timing .
It may well be tactical on the part of the SNP to wait until 2014 , but I think it 's practical too .
Who gets the Trident subs ?
Who gets the armed forces ?
Does Scotland stay in the EU ?
Does it keep the pound ?
What about their oil ?
Do the English have a say ?
These are all in my view huge issues .
It 's the biggest decision in 300 years and it needs to be made slowly I think .
Give the Scots two years to make their minds up , because it 's not as simple as the Westminster government wants to make out .
I do applaud them though for trying to get the legal issues sorted out .
I am so tired of this debate , but I guess it 's going to keep cropping up .
Independence would be worse for both scotland and the rest of the UK.
As Scots are we really so different that we 'd toss aside the political , cultural and economic benefits of the union so that we can massage our own egos and yell " FREEDOM ! " ?
There was an SNP canvaser at my door today , so my mum decided to annoy him , and told him she voted tory ... for which he had no response and got all flustered , then when asked which party she would vote for in the next election she said she did n't vote for a party , she voted for a person , and he got confused , then she said she would n't vote for independence , and he was genuinely surprised and did n't know what to say
The SNP seem to think that just because they won the election it means that the whole country wants independence , when actually they probably won the election because they wanted free prescriptions , free tuition , free care for the elderly etc. while other parties were n't offering as much ( although , it does beg the question of where exactly all this money is coming from ? )
Now for a bit of intentional controversial and completely ignorant ' tarring with the same brush ' type questions :
is this what ' British ' people think ?
I know many people do n't think like this bitch but this is appaling .
should she have her kid taken away from her ?
You see the other ' British ' woman did n't defend the others but was more concerned with having to take care of her baby that was about to wake up , which means one ' British ' woman was being racist , and the other ' British ' woman was just letting it pass , being more worried about something else .
So does that mean that most ' British ' woman think like this ?
You also have to admit that the lady arguing with the raving bitch had no reason to say ' We 're here because you do n't work , go find a job ' , that 's wrong and a bit racist within itself .
The like to dislike ration on this video is around 3:1 , what does that show ?
what do you think ?
If you allow her to have this opinion is it because you project the same feelings ?
What would be the point in arguing with her ?
The women is so steeped in her own ignorance it would take years to educate her
She 's entitled to her own opinion .
Someone should have just given her a slap just to shut her up
Wow , she 's gonna be REALLY pissed in about 20 years . HAHAHA !
But seriously , if all English / British people were like her ..... why would anyone WANT to be English / British .
I actually think she has something wrong with her , whether she is on drugs or drunk .
But she is slurring a lot .
The fact she called Nigeria ... Nygigreeah .... I think she was half with it ...
No - one in their right mind , starts screaming and swearing like that , with their young child sat on their lap ...
Also , to say most British women think the same , is wrong .
I 'm a British woman and would never dream of acting like that .
You said the one other British lady did not stand up for the others , but ...
1. She actually did , by telling the loud mouthed cow to shut up .
2. Although she should n't have to , why do you think she has to get involved ?
Just because she is British ?
3. Several other people , who were n't British did n't get involved ... does that make them racist too .. ?
4. If I were in that situation , and I had a child with me , I would try my hardest not to get involved , as it would n't be fair on my child .
But if the arguing caused my child to be disturbed , then I would have done the same and got involved .
I agree that what I have watched in this video is sickening , but I disagree with several points you have made .
And I would actually say some of your points are rather racist and offensive to British women .
You may be angry at what you have seen , but that is NO reason to group all British women as racist .
Seems stabbing is becoming as regular as farting , soon there will be so many knives on the streets it will bring back the UK 's steel making to what it was 50 years ago .
Along with tougher sentancing I dont know what else could be done that would'nt upset the bleeding heart liberals ( no pun intended )
I would rather be stabbed by a childish fool than be harassed by the police on a daily basis .
EDIT : I will clarify - I would rather take the risk of being stabbed than have my freedom infringed on a regular basis .
did u know statistically ethnic minorites are more than likely to be stopped and searched .
Just saying that this kind of measure to stop and search anyone - i do n't really see as appropriate .
Recently France decided to ban the burka in public places in the interest of public security .
I both agree and disagree with this statement .
Some women feel the burka empowers them , but other feel trapped by it .
So is it a public security issue or just some anti semetic judgement ?
Is a piece of cloth wrong ? In what way ?
Intimidating or forcing one into dressing a particular way is wrong .
It has been said that if teenages can not wear hoodies in shops as it conceals their identity why should somebody to wear a burka ?
I 'm a Muslim and I did n't agree with much of what he said , but I ca n't deny that he was a fantastic orator .
Whether you agree with his views or not , you have to respect the man 's incredible intellect and sharp wit .
I happen to agree with his views on religion and so I must thank him for teaching me an incredble amount of factual knowledge but more importantly , the ability to think critically .
I do n't have any Johnnie Walker so I hope a glass of this JD will suffice .
Thank you for everything Hitch .
You are truly my inspiration .
I was a Hitchens fanboi for a year or so and the fact this is actually really quite upsetting is a testament to just how good his writing is , that he can have such an incredible impact on peoples lives .
Even the guy above who is a glad he is dead has been seduced by the Hitch 's writing in that you either devote yourself to him or hate him above all else .
( That guy is obviously far too stupid to comprehend this though guys so best to just ignore him )
I was n't such a fan of his habit of preaching opinion as truth , then again I 'm not a big fan of rhetoric in general .
Nevertheless , he exercised his right to freedom of speech to the nth degree and gave a lot of people strength in the process .
He will be missed .
A contrarian and freethinker until the end . He left no one untouched ... from Mother Teresa to Bill Clinton and Henry Kissinger .
A fantastic orator , extremely well - read and a sharp wit ...
It 's a sad , sad loss .
We need more people that go out of their way to challenge the " false refuge of consensus " he has referred to and warned against seeking .
I 'm coming across so many good quotes from him !
On Reagan : " He 's doing to the country what he can no longer do to his wife . "
On a TV evangelist : " If you gave him an enema you could bury him in a matchbox . "
I may have supported his anti - religiousness but , whatever your opinion on it , you have to admire the courage of his convictions .
He only said what he thought was right and , if we had more people around today like that ( namely in politics ) , the world would be a better place .
When I heard about his death this morning my mood completely shifted .
His writings and speeches were such a huge influence on me during those most tumultuous teenage years , the years in which I was " tentatively feeling my way into the life of the freethinker " in the words of Dawkins , and served as a brilliant rebuttal to the dogma I was being fed in Catholic school .
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hitchens at the " Great God Debate " last year here in Boston and in retrospect , I 'm glad I had that opportunity before his untimely , yet nonetheless inevitable demise .
what are the chances that TM when we wake up in the morning , we switch on to the news and see breaking news that prince Philip has died after overnight heart problems
the guy is in his 90 's
what are the chances he survives this so far look very silm
I pray for his swift recovery and many more years of life and service to the UK and Commonwealth .
Much as I am fond of the Royal Family if he dies I really hope we do n't end up seeing a load of scenes that would not look out of place in North Korea and a Media circus .
It is about time someone reminded all these naive women that no matter what your " rights " are , you still have to take responsibility for your safety or sadly face the consequences .
EDIT : So ... 87 96 people would risk being raped rather than getting a taxi ?
Well do n't come crying to TSR when you get a reality check .
It 's a sad fact of our society that you have to think ahead all the time to ensure your safety .
It should n't be - you should be able to dance down backalleys naked , drunk at 3 in the morning if you wanted to without anyone trying to cause you harm , but unfortunately there are always those who will take advantage , so you should always watch your drinks , stay within your limit and never ever wander off on your own .
Oh thank Lord , someone talking sense .
Why are we telling women not to get raped instead of telling men not to rape ?
It 's not like getting a taxi is even something everyone can do .
You ca n't always afford a taxi ( especially if you 're in London ! ) , you ca n't always flag one down , you might not have a working phone on you ( lack of credit , lack of battery ) and you might have a phone but no idea of local taxi numbers .
Does this mean you deserve to be raped ?
Obviously not .
The point here should be ' if you see a woman walking alone at night , do n't rape her ' as opposed to ' if you 're a woman , or have any chance of being perceived as one , do n't walk around alone at night ' .
It is easier for men not to rape than women not to be raped .
You just do n't rape .
EDIT : I seem to have been misconstrued by a couple of people here , so I 'll elaborate .
Women have a responsibility to mitigate the risk of bad things happening to them , like any of us .
I am not saying that women should realistically be able to dance down back alleys naked .
I am saying that the only person with the power to eradicate the risk is the prospective perpetrator .
If a girl is raped , it is not her fault even if she did n't take the adequate measures to mitigate risk , because that risk would have been there irrespective of how careful she may have been .
Rape victims do not have the power to prevent rape .
Only the would - be rapist does .
On that basis , the above interviewer 's handling of the subject seems to me to have been insensitive in the extreme .
Women should not be made to feel bad for having been raped .
Now if these lot rioting and looting were South Asians or , god forbid Muslims , forum would be filled with anti - Multiculturalism rhetoric - where derogative comments about an entire group of people would be acceptable .
Often these people would decry the " PC liberal media " for not calling it out .
So , we all know the crime problems in the black community in London , why are n't you calling it out as an example of Multiculturalism failing ?
You 're probably thinking it , but do n't want to say it .
Heaven forbid , have you become politically correct overnight ?
You clearly have n't been on TSR today .
There are have been numerous threads about the black community etc.
It kind of gets boring after a while .
They are : I do n't know about TSR , but you should look at the comments on the Telegraph website .
Mind , they do n't need much encouragement .
Why should it be a racial thing .
Most of the past riots have been majorly white , nobody starts banging on about race then and they should n't .
I 've seen a lot of racism today and its unacceptable .
Forget about race
Found this blog earlier which talks about the need to slow population growth .
The blogger puts forward a two child policy as the answer .
Any thoughts ?
The only countries that would be able to implement this already have birth rates below replacement ( or will do soon )
The only area of real population growth in the future is going to be Africa , and I ca n't imagine any African states being able to exert this level of control and organisation on their citizens .
Most of the words that come out of his mouth these days seem to be trying to lure catholic votes .
It seems that he knows under the current population changes ( if it continues ) that Ireland will eventually unite .
But how can he possibly ' end sectarianism ' if members of his party come out with purely bigotory remarks ( such as Ian McMrea 's in the summer time ) ?
How can he possibly change the mind set of unionists who vote for nationalist parties ( SDLP ) purely to keep SF out of a seat ?
How can he change the mindset of hardline nationalists who see SF as traitors and refuse to vote at all ?
It seems that such a beautiful land had been created that it had to be balanced out , so it was sent the most evil of inhabitants to curse the land forever ...
I think it 's a noble aspiration and , yes , unionists need to reach out to Roman Catholics .
There 's nothing ideologically unsound about that - after all , most Roman Catholics in Scotland , England and Wales are Unionists , why should history prevent that from being the case in Northern Ireland ?
I 've not heard his full remarks , just what I garnered from the radio and a couple of short bits in articles , but it really sounded good and - whilst I still ca n't bring myself to think of the DUP as decent , mainstream and cross - community - I think it 's a step in the right direction .
It surprised me .
Do n't particularly give a * * * * .
Never been to NI .
However , if the majority want to keep up a Union with Great Britain then that 's fine .
What 's everyone 's opinions of it ?
Does it bring out English pride ?
Does it look like a piece of junk ?
Tell me .
It really is n't very good looking is it . Even from a distance .
Kinda looks like a rollar coaster with some ugly grey tower going up the middle of it .
Ahh well , good to know tax payers money is being well spent .
At least , I 'm guessing the tax payer payed for this .
nasty tv guys ! yuc , I hate them
If he wants it done , I do n't see what the problem is .
I dont think there is anything wronge with the except for the name of the program ; " Mumifying Alan "
He agreed to do it .
What 's the problem ?
I do n't see why so many people are against grammar schools , when really segregation happens anyway in comprehensive schools .
The best abled pupils get put into the " top " set and usually get the best teacher in the subject department etc.
If that 's the case then why not just reintroduce grammar schools instead of doing this half hearted attempt at trying to make it look like everything is equal ?
Really , what was the point in the government making me eat lunch in the same room as violent yobo 's anyway and having to watch out for being attacked in the hall way or fireworks snuck in ?
I feel like they were just trying to piss me off , and I kind of am , at them and the socialists who push for this kind of crap .
Are n't they phasing out grammar schools ?
There was one not far from me but it 's just a regular middle / high school now .
Where I 'm from 10 % of children will pass the 11 + and get into the grammar school .
The other 90 % are called failures at 11 and sent to an underfunded sink school .
Why is it fair that 10 % of children get 90 % of the funding ?
Grammar schools also do n't allow for children to move up if they start working harder , it 's much easier to move from the bottom set to the top set within a school than it is to move from the comprehensive to the grammar school .
Everyone deserves the chance for a good education not just the lucky 10 % who get into the grammar school based on one exam at the age of 11 .
How will Libya 's oil reserves of 46 + billion be divvied up ?
If not the oil atleast a decent portion of Libyas future outward FDI .
Hopefully now we 'll avoid a double dip or prolonged recession .
Get that oil flowing , dammit .
Long live the The Libyan Interim National Council !!
If we wanted oil contracts why would we bother with this ?
We should have just supported Gaddafi and he would have rewarded our support with more oil contracts .
Oh and just because there are reserves it does not mean they are financially viable , plus the TNC could just tell us to * * * * off like Iraq did .
This is nothing more than a glorified Bay of Pigs
The UK 's Share of loot will be minumum , but BP will make a killing its investments are safe it has avoided a long drawn out civil war .

Pan African Solidarity movement has lost
I was in Guatemala when the CIA was preparing its attack on [ President Arbenz of Guatemala , 1954 ] .
His state had no revenues ; its biggest income maker was United Fruit Company .
So Arbenz put the tiniest of taxes on bananas ...
We installed a military dictator and there 's been nothing but bloodshed ever since . " -- Gore Vidal
History repeats it self
I do n't really know what spoils are to be had , Libya only produces 2 % of the world 's oil .
At least the end of the revolution / civil war will make oil cheaper .
It 'll give political spoils to Cameron and Sarkozy , though , as long as the new government do n't cut off umpteen heads in reprisals .
Unless you meant something different , BP went back into profit only a few months after the Gulf of Mexico spill .
Can someone explain the reason behind these riots to me ?
I 'm kinda slow , I have n't been following the news for the past couple of days .
I log into TSR and am greeted by loads of threads about how it 's all kicking off in London ( and a few scuffles in Brum too ) but no explanation how they started then I go to the BBC site to try and get to the bottom of it but still no explanation !
Basically , a guy got shot in London , police claim he was a gangbanger and shot a police officer , local people claim he was innocent .
initial tests reveal he did n't fire a bullet .
Anyways , this killing led to a riot in Tottenham and people realised they could just break down shop windows and take what they want , and burn cars without being held accountable .
So soon enough it spread to all over London ... and now birmingham
So you 're saying there is no reason ?
They just wanted a riot for riot 's sake ?
Basically , a man called Mark Duggan was shot to death on Thursday reportedly by police , a bunch of people staged a peaceful protest and from that people have started using violence , looting and setting buildings on fire , and it 's getting worse because they 're realising that police ca n't do anything about it .
The papers have it all wrong .
I live right in the middle of this crap , and I know of the sort of people who 're getting involved , and it really just boils down to some entitled pricks who 've realised that the police wo n't stop them from nicking things they want if they do it simultaneously , morality be damned .
That incident might have been the spark , but believe me on this , mate , there is no cause behind it anymore .
People are just taking things because they can .
Most of the trouble around London is copy cat violence of what happened in tottenham where a 29 year old was shot by the police sparking of a protest which gott out of control .
People saw the looting going on and wanted some themselves therefore organising a riot .
So , anyone from Gloucester ?
Riot police , police dogs and police helicopters confirmed .
Sounds like the old college , the old woolworths and a car or 2 are on fire .
Many other shops attacked including Argos , Asda and a couple on Kings Walk .
Bad times
i work in argos and apparently it hasnt even been touched it was just the old college and barton street and woolworths .
ive heard that more is going on tonight though in the main town but we 'll just have to see , really pathetic though makes me so angry .
really sad it 's hit gloucester but i 'm not that surprised .
hopefully these idiots will get bored soon enough and there will not be any more damage done !
London is burning and the media are not broadcasting ANYTHING about it .
Twitter is going mental with reports of bomb threats , mass looting , fires etc.
This website is updating every couple of minutes ....
Enfield , Brixton , Chingford , Walthanstow , Dalston ..... all being looted ... all being set on fire .
A massive Morrisons in chingford has just been set alight ( from twitter ) .... this is MENTAL !
EDIT : People were throwing petrol bombs from bridges onto passing cars on the A 10 earlier ....
Have the Police enforced a compulsory MEDIA BLACKOUT ???
The news is being purposely hidden from the world ( to discourage further riots ? ) .
Ive just emailed all the big news agencies making them aware that we know they are hiding this ......
doubt i 'll get a reply , or anything will change on the news .
I think in the middle of all this carnage , everybody needs to take a step back and just hug the internet .
The only omniscient thing I 'm aware that exists .
I was just watching SKY news and the riots are all they were talking about for the past 10-15 minutes .
this is completely unjustifiable .
Any sympathy the general public had for the man whose death supposedly spurred on this onslaught of violence is surely being eroded by the minute when thugs are smashing up the businesses , cars and homes of innocent people who had NOTHING TO DO WITH IT .
Was in Brixton for the Splash this afternoon , got violent at 5 o clock or so , very few police considering there were thousands of ppl , also hard to find first aiders WHY DID N'T THE MEDIA REPORT THIS EARLIER ! ?
They focus on shops being burnt late in the evening but not violence at a family - friendly festival etc
Just wondering about the economic effects of these riots ...
I do n't think that we 'll see any substantive impact in the City unless the riots do actually spread from the periphery to the Docklands , or even the Square Mile itself which I consider very unlikely .
But this is going to his tourism badly .
It 's going to hit tourism really badly .
Tourists are n't going to want to go to a city that 's unsafe where the police can allow mob rule in the streets for three consecutive nights , and understandably so .
this is the message leaving our country to foreign investors : ' We , here in England , are mindless barbarians .
If you put your business here , it will not be treated with respect , it may be destroyed , clearly we do n't have the money to buy your products ' .
If i were a foreign investor right now , I 'd be looking elsewhere .
It 's perhaps just the final nail in the coffin .
I 'm not his biggest critic by any means , but this is the most out of touch thing Cameron has said so far IMO .
" The whole country wants young people given the opportunity that work experience provides . "
What a misleading statement .
The country wants unemployed people to have jobs , not be forced to work for nothing .
You would have to be insanely right - wing to describe anyone who thinks people should be paid for work as a Trotskyite .
A lot of people on the right are opposed to the idea of what is effectively a tax - payer funded subsidy to large businesses in the form of free labour .
My take it on this is that it 's a very poor solution to the catch - 22 situation hitting most young job - seekers , but that it 's better than the future jobs fund and / or doing nothing .
It 's not forced though , it is voluntary .
Secret tip on how to avoid this ' slave labour ' : When they ask if you want to do it , say no.
No it 's not .
It is if you say yes and quit before completion then you lose benefits for 2 weeks ( if an 8 week scheme ) .
One issue is that the actual scheme and the administration of the scheme are not matching up .
The voluntary scheme itself is perfectly fine .
However , something has gone wrong in the way the job centre have been portraying it to some people , making it seem mandatory .
I know they think it is , and the prime minister is elected democratically .
But there is the house of lords and it pretty much feels like a country of ' lords ' and its like we are still stuck with some middle ages traditions .
what do you think ?
yes , although I 'd like to see a change from first past the post to proportional representation .
Also , to the OP , I 'm pretty sure that there are hardly any hereditary peers left in the house of lords
It absolutely is a democratic country .
We have an elected House of Commons which is sovereign .
People point to the inherited monarchy and the llife peerage as signs of not being democratic , but ignore one significant thing :
Many other democratic countries worldwide do not elected their Head of State or their Upper House .
For example : Germany , Italy , Canada , Australia , Japan , Holland , Spain , Belgium , Sweden , Norway , Denmark , Czech Republic , Hungary , Greece and many others do not elect the Head of State .
Likewise , Ireland , Canada , Germany , France , Holland , Jamaica and many others do not elect their Upper House - at least not directly .
As long as the elected portion of the State ( i.e. the House of Commons ) has supreme power , then the democratic imperative is satisfied .
Ironically , having other portions of the State elected will invite deadlock and compromise , and the democratic will of the people will be drowned out in the politicking that will go on .
The Lords increases democracy in the UK - it 's a safeguard .
Firslty the Chamber , although it has party politics , is kept in balance so it is not as partisan as the commons .
Secondly it is a chamber of experts which functions in a largely advisory capacity .
Thirdly these guys are lifers , which means they are able to think past the next election for the good of the country .
I have far more faith in the Lords as it stands than in the FPTP house of commons which leads to barracking by two parties who are becoming increasingly differentiated only by the spelling .

Do you think it might have something to do with the fact that 70 % of the people of these islands do not want this mass immigration yet our government allows million from very different cultures to immigrate to these islands .
We call anyone who says this racist . The U.N has defined rights for indigenous peoples .
We stand up for the rights of the indigenous Tibetans , Native Americans , Maori and say that Gandhi was a hero for standing up for the rights of the Indian people , but if someone wants to champion the rights of the British indigenous people they are either called racists , people want to have a riot against them and some people would send them to the gas chamber .
Do you think the pressure of this suppression eventually gives way to these racist rants which are becoming so commonplace that youtube is literally filled with dozens of them .
Do you think it is just a co - incidence that some foul mouth racists stand up and deliver some foul mouth speech or do you think that this is symptomatic of the fact that the British people have had enough of immigration and this is the start of revolt .
Black people do n't work
Therefore they ca n't afford cars
Therefore they use the bus with the uneducated white chavs
( the first bit is a joke btw , im not a racist = [ )
The rights of the British white population do n't really need championing .
The only reason one would do so would be to legitimise ostracising people from other ethnic backgrounds .
That 's why championing rights for whites is viewed with suspicion , to my mind .
We do n't get .
I 've never seen one .
Where they happen they become viral videos and even make the newspapers .
You might as sensibly ask " why do we get so many dogs falling off trampolines at barbecues ? " or whatever it is that wins this week 's 500 quid on you 've been framed .
The racist people that we have seen on such footage are generally quite poor and therefore take public transport .
They evidently are quite angry that they do n't have much money and therfore take their anger out on other races and point the blame on them ...
I 'd respect what she said if she did n't call me a " * * * * ing foreign * * * * head " .
Do n't agree with sending her to jail though , what happened to free speech ?
I guess being unfair neutralises having a fare
It must be the new craze sweeping the nation !
Is there any evidence of a racist rant on an aeroplace yet ?
That 'd be the icing on the cake
because they are uninformed and support the BNP .
Okay , not trolling or anything but i have a question .
Why ? I understand what both the BNP and EDL want in terms of aspirations and goals , ive studied policies and many responses to them .
But from what i 've observed via TSR and many news sources ; the way they 're trying to achieve them , is largely violent EDIT : specific coverage of EDL , whom seem to make the headlines a little more .
Aggression and hostility is obviously the worst way to go about to get these changes made .
Do n't they realise it ?
I 've seen very little peaceful protests go on , which causes me to question the validity of both the BNP and EDL .
And whether they 're genuinely thinking for the better of this country or they just house people who just want a fight , that have the option to jump on the bandwagon of UK politics . Hence this thread .
I 'm not blaming anyone , im largely trying to remain neutral .
However , riots and fights take two to tango and there is obviously a massive contribution from the opposing party .
But , im just trying to get a bigger picture here .
I 'd like for this to be a calm discussion and an informative thread .
For members and followers of both the EDL and BNP to come and justify their points across so , not just i , but many others can be educated properly on the intentions and the reasoning behind it all . Regards .
First of all , I have no affiliation with the BNP , I find them ridiculous .
But how exactly are they violent ?
I mean , aside from the couple of mental members in the past , I have n't seen much violence coming from BNP members .
Infact , overwhelmingly they seem to be the victims of violence and repression .
As for the EDL . Well , the thing is , they were never set up with specific political aims .
They were set up as an angry response to radical Islam and Islamisation , they are a street group , not a Westminster lobby .
Sadly , some of their demo 's have been marred by violence .
But an agressive opposition , along with a biased press and press with an agenda make them out to be a lot worse than they are .
That said , they are far from good .
The majority are loutish and do n't have any great intellectual capacity , but that does n't mean you should write them off , or that you should oppose their aims .
People who do n't think the BNP are violent do n't know * * * * about the history of the BNP .
Yeah they wear suits now , but in the 80s and early 90s it was n't a political ' party ' , it was just a street gang that used to fight with AFA and commit random acts of violence and vandalism against non - whites .
You ca n't change that history by appearing on Question Time .
And before anyone storms in with the negs and the ' that 's just slander where 's the evidence of this ' , Google is your friend , do your own research on the BNP vs AFA and the links between the BNP and the NF , Combat 18 , National Socialist Movement etc etc etc
With the Scottish vote generally being a Labour vote ( 41 of 59 seats ) would losing Scotland give The Conservative party a clear advantage ?
The Conservatives would lose one MP , were as Labour would lose 41 MP 's .
Although Labour would of still won in 2001 without Scotland , The Conservatives would of had a 21 seat majority in the last general election .
As well as this the forthcoming boundary changes will see Labour lose 28 seats compared to 7 for The Conservatives , not to mention union donation caps that would decrease party funding for Labour .
With all the said , and with Conservatives likely to hold a natural majority if Scotland gain independence , would that cause Labour to push further to the right in order to try and steal the Conservative vote and effectively leave behind the working class ?
Personally I do n't think they 'd have much choice .
I am interested in hearing peoples opinions on this .
Unsure tbh , maybe would make the UK slightly more right wing but ca n't imagen it becoming majorly right .
Conservatives won a majority of the vote ( but not a majority of the seats , hmm ) in England in 2005 and no doubt many more elections where Labour won in the UK.
Wales are in between .
I wonder how NI would vote if the unionists chose between liblabcon rather then D / UUP
What I find worrying is that you think it is OK for a political party to change its core values and ideals , purely for the sake of gaining power .
Not because they believe in what they are saying .
I 'm not saying that it does n't happen already , but you seem to be implying that it is a totally understandable thing to do ?
Unless I 've misunderstood what you are saying ?
Anyway , my personal opinion is that Labour are n't truly left wing and the Conservatives definitely are n't right wing .
They are as bad as each other .
As a ' right wing ' person ( * cringe * ) , I sympathise more with some Conservative policies but I do n't really like their leadership .
On the other hand , I detest Labour with a passion .
Good riddance if they loose their foothold in English politics .
Stealing the jobs traditionally done by teenagers . Absolutely disgusting .
Immigration does need to reflect surplus jobs available .
However , you get people like that girl suing the government for making her work in poundland not making things better for anyone .
whilst in some cases this is true half the time these people do the work the rest of the british refuse to do ...
persay street cleaners as a prime example i cant remember the last time i saw a brit doing it yet people whine about the ' evil foreigners taking our jobs '
if they wouldnt be so anally retentive in what they wished to do .
and on the broader issue thats what you get for joining the EU you win some you loose some , simple .
basically with all this fuss about Scottish Independence in the news I 'm wondering how this bears for people who are n't 100 % ' pure blooded Scot ' for 7 generations or something .
I dunno why but it just boggles my brain .
If the SNP get their way and crown Salmond as king of his own private domain , who determines who is and is n't Scottish ?
EU work and residency rights no longer apply following independence , and I can see this potential event doing nothing but fuelling xenophobia , racism and nasty nationalism .
Many English people have Scottish relatives or relatives living in Scotland long term , many Scots move down to England , marry English people or have English relatives .
Who decides if they 're Scottish or not ?
People who have lived in Scotland for decades could potentially find themselves aliens in their own homes , potentially considered foreign or ' not quite native ' .
What about people who consider themselves British living in a British territory suddenly find themselves on the ' wrong ' side of the border ?
It seems absurd that they should suddenly consider Scotland as somehow ' foreign ' .
Residents of other EU countries would suddenly find themselves without EU protections either .
Why is the SNP so obsessed with independence when there is no real political or economic mandate for it ?
Surely it has to be for more than some infantile kneejerk obsession with the Brave - heart movie and a unjustified grievance with highly slanted views on history ?
Scotland gains nothing but gets lumped with stupid debt and political fallout , loss of influence and still economically and culturally tied to the rest of the UK as to make an international border seem utterly insane .
The Scots themselves are an amalgamation of different peoples , Picts , Britons , Gaels , Norse and even Anglo - Saxons .
It 's ironic that some Scots take issue with the United Kingdom while ignoring that Scotland was created in much the same fashion .
So TSR , who decides what a Scot in a ' free ' Scotland is ?
Someone that has a heritage that clearly shows that the family have been in Scotland for a long time they are Scottish obviously although I am sure that someone born there would also be considered Scottish as well ?
the only people who are not Scottish would be those who move there à la not born there or have any previous family who were born in Scotland .
As for who decides that could be tricky although I doubt it will be much of an issue .
I do n't see the situation being any different to the relationship between the UK and Ireland .
It would n't really matter if someone is a Scottish citizen or a UK citizen , because they will have equal rights in both countries .
Right now Irish citizens can freely live in the UK and can vote in general elections and even run for office .
I 'm sure the same thing would happen with Scotland .
It does still raise the question of exactly who can get Scottish citizenship , but it wo n't really make any practical difference to people who do n't qualify for it .
Scottish citizenship would probably be open to people living in Scotland on the day it becomes independent , and anyone who has at least one grandparent who was born there , or something like that .
Look at Irish citizenship laws , it would probably end up being quite similar .
Its an interesting question .
I was born in Scotland to parents who were born and raised in England , but then my mothers side ( she 's an Anderson ) has a long history of Scottish ancestry .
I lived there till I was four , but have lived the rest of my life in England .
Am I a Scot ?
I imagine I will be able to apply for Scottish citizenship , but will I be able to vote in a referendum ?
I doubt it .
In recent times and quite a bit more in the past it has always been heavily played on that UK prisoners are some if the most expensive people to keep in the UK.
So I was thinking , why are n't we making the people who have the ability to pay ( ie - those people who have any sort of savings or credits ) to stay in prison ?
Some prisoners are in prison with large amounts of money in the bank so why are n't we taking money back off of these people to cover the costs involved in keeping them and court costs ?
If people commit the crime people should be willing to do the time and the people who can afford it , should pay for it surely ?
What are other peoples views ?
Yeah man totally agree man they should register to a Student Loan alternative man and then like , sort of pay it off after their time in jail innit , i 'm gonna buy the domain PrisonLoans.co.uk now before anybody else smart steals it
The law should treat everyone equally - You ca n't have some people paying and others not .
I agree with you that those that can should be able to pay .
However this also raises the issue that since they are paying money as well as serving their time in jail , their sentence should be reduced .
If this were to happen , would it not be unfair that other prisoners that do not have the means to pay and have committed ' lesser ' crimes have to serve longer than those that can ' buy ' their way out of jail , so to speak ?
Taking HIV as an example , the immigrant population has ten times the level of infection of the other 88 % of the UK.
The other diseases are even more extremely biased .
What are your thoughts on this situation ?
Personally I think it 's a very good thing , since our NHS should be working to treat all of the world 's sick people and the more diseased immigrants we have , the more good it can do for them .
Also , having them living among us massively increases the risk of infection for the general population , making for a fair society .
Why should we get to enjoy relatively low risk of serious infections when other parts of the world are in great danger of them ?
Testing immigrants as a condition of entry to the UK would set us back decades and is morally wrong anyway .
Their health status is none of our business .
Yeah it is something that we should keep an eye on but what about people without medical record ?
What do we do with them quarantine them while we wait on test results ?
I 'm surprised that we do n't do this anyway .
Surely , as a matter of common sense , if we get plenty of people from countries where diseases like HIV and TB are rife , it 's best to test for it and treat them upon arrival ?
Both to prevent them spreading it to the rest of the population and also for the welfare of the affected immigrants .
How is that an infringement on human rights ... ?
Coming to the UK is a choice .
We already impose conditions on entry , why would one more be wrong ?
The problem is that you 'd have to pay to deport immigrants who fail the tests when they refuse to leave of their own accord .
So , I 've been reading about Scottish independence and I do n't think it 's fair to solely concentrate on Scottish independence and I 'd like to get the overall views of TSR members .
Simple choice , either independence for your home country or to retain membership of the UK.
On the one hand , the union gives us a bigger economy and population , and if it broke up we 'd be less powerful .
On the other hand it 's a good way to get rid of 5 million Labour voters and let the predominantly Conservative England free itself of Scotland 's socialist yoke .
So I 'm not really bothered either way .
So I disagree with the whole Tory ethos , and ca n't stand what they 're doing to this country out of sheer idealogy blahblahblah ...
But the reason I really ca n't stand Cameron and his current cabinet is that they are constantly trying to pull the wool over the publics eyes .
Whether it 's by saying all those in the public sector who will be striking on Wednesday are selfish , or by Osbourne selflessly wiping the VAT on the X - Factor charity single , conveniently being named live on X Factor infront on millions of viewers .
They ripped Labour apart on the immigration issue in the general election , now look at the mess its in !!
Does anyone care ?
Here 's a link explaining the situation as some of you " Righties " are oblivious to the situation .
Food prices / petrol prices are sky high .
When petrol costs rose when Labour were in government , there was a media frenzy .
Likewise when services had to shut down after a day because of snow , the media launched a full blown attack and everyday people were saying how disgusting it was .
When it snowed under the Tories and services shut for up to a week , noone cared .
Likewise noone was particularly fussed when Osbourne blamed the rubbish economy " growth " on the snow / royal wedding .
Imagine the furore Labour had said such a stupidly false thing .
Sneaky NHS shake - ups .
If any of you have even used the NHS and have lived / travelled abroad for a period of time , you will probably know how lucky we are to have such an amazing health service .
There was absolutely no need to open it up to private firms , and he swore blind in those televised debates that his party would n't touch our NHS .
What a crock .
Youth unemployment the highest its ever been .
It 's been almost 17 months since the coalition has been in now , not 15 months as one of you said , or just 6 months as another one of you said
So blaming Labour for the world recession ( which by the way would have been even worse had the Tories been in gov in the same years ) almost 17 months on where our economy has gone backwards in terms of economic growth from when Labour left office , is ridiculous .
How many more years are you going to use it as an excuse for what is essentially a Tory government dismantling the public sector while it can get away with it .
Public sector workers being singled out to pay more into their pension funds ...
My sister is a primary school teacher and teachers generally hate the tories , before all this pension business came to the surface but because they 're so backward when it comes to education .
She has to pay out of her own wages for all her teaching activites / reading books / teaching supplies and only has a teaching assistant twice a week now because they 've withdrawn so much money from the school budget .
She 's a great teacher so buys all that stuff , whereas a lot of teachers might not bother as to be fair why should they have to spend hundreds a year ? !
Teaching standards are going to fall massively over the next few years .
Why wo n't the people of this country wake up and stop allowing Cameron to brainwash them ???
You need not to tell us why , as we already know .
We are like this because of financial issues out of our control and the mess of the last government .
If only Cameron was doing it out of ideology !
I would like a small public sector in this country .
Government spending is actually increasing .
You can hardly call the NHS shake up sneaky .
Public sector pensions will still be much better than private .
How dare we bring Public Sector pensions more into line with the Private sector ?
Just who do we think we are ?
Please , the average life span is ever increasing , it 's put the contributions up , the pensio value down , or work longer .
There are no other choices , the Public sector have been spared this by 13 years of spineless Labour government , but the fact is we can not take this burden on at the expense of the tax payer any longer .
most of those problems you just described are the result of a floundering labour government who let spending go out of control and allowed the NHS to disintegrate .
whilst I agree that D Cameron and the tories are n't doing everything they said they would , they are trying to cut back the welfare state and dismantle some of the ridiculous laws that stop businesses and workers from operating at their highest
also , petrol prices are the result of numerous international economic factors and OPEC price control , the british government can not control that .
OP trying to win brownie points from other clueless students who hate the Conservative party just because .
And failing .
Badly .
Possibly because there 's no money to do anything anymore .
Why ? Because the wonderful Labour party pissed away trillions on trying to create a client state .
Absolutely there are problems in immigration .
This comes the same week that reports ( costing the taxpayer millions ) are finally published , having been commissioned by Labour , but never released due to their findings which basically concluded that Labour made the worst mistakes imaginable on immigration .
Food prices are generally not the domain of the government , and the food prices in the UK are relatively low compared to continental Europe - certainly the Eurozone .
Been to Cyprus recently ?
GBP 4 for a packet of butter , anyone ?
Fuel duty has been relatively slow to change since the General Election .
When Labour came to power in 1997 , you could buy petrol at the pump for 49. 9p per litre .
When they left , it was over GBP 1.30 .
Labour could n't do enough NHS reorganisation .
Have you seen what an NHS executive earns ?
How about a doctor or nurse that does n't actually have any patients ?
There are a lot of them working for health quangoes set up by Labour .
Very true .
There is a recession on , and the country was on it 's knees thanks to rocket scientist G. Brown .
Damn right .
Why should n't they ?
Why should they be the only people to have gold - plated pensions with no detriment to anyone except the tax payer ?
What about private sector pensions - they 're generally worthless .
Why ? Because they were raped by Gordon Brown .
At a stroke , by taxing dividends he destroyed private pensions , costing countless trillions , but benefiting the treasury a few billion which he whizzed away on social engineering .
No one believes that . Cameron is part of a coalition government , and faces widespread opposition from the likes of you , and hard - liners in his own party .
I would suggest also that large numbers of people in Britain are also resigned to the fact that the country had its back broken during the tenure of Blair and Brown .
except OP explained exactly why they hate the tories ...
Nah I 'd go for sensible people with a realist outlook myself .
Why would you call anybody " scum " for holding a moderate political view ?
Does that post really constitute anything worth replying to , any well thought and argued points ?
It is just the same politically illiterate ramblings you hear from any Tory hating band wagoners , this should be left for the columns of Heat magazine rather than a debate forum .
A study have found there are twice as many mixed race people than reported in the census .
Around 2 % of British people are mixed race .
Coupled with mass immigration , established immigrants having children , and white flight .
The White British will all to soon dissapear , just another lost race in the pages of a history book .
Tony Blair defended his immigration policies a couple of months back and I have to say I agree with him .
I 've always viewed immigration 's goal was to try change Britain 's demographics and making it a fairer society in the long run .
IMO we have become a more mulitcultural nation , and and an ethnically richer diverse one at that which was necessary .
Changing the demographics is important for Britain , it 's important for a lot of nations .
To those anti - immigrant nationalists who hate this , look at Obama , probably one of the most popular human beings of all time , if not the most popular ever .
A lot of people like him for his charisma , his charm , his looks , his speeches even , I and many others also like him for his ethnicity ( sorry but I do it 's healthy for the world ) .
Obama 's mixed race background highlights humanities love for mixed race people and our destiny to wanting to become mixed race .
There is no doubt this is the way the world is going .
And Obama as a figure head and his popularity proves that .
Stunning president .
So Tony Blair was right about immigration , and we are becoming more diverse thankfully , like America , because of it .
And maybe one day too we will have our own Obama .
Viva la difference .
Thank you Tony Blair .
Where Tony Blair and his government got it wrong was in underestimating the number who would migrate from the new countries in the EU , and not then providing the resources to support this , for example in English language support in schools .
For non - EU migrants and those seeking to live in the country , the support and resources to enable decisions on their future to be made in a short period of time .
Depends on if you believe Blair did it for electoral reasons or not .
Immigration is good for a society , but opening the floodgates like he did is quite frankly dangerous .
OP spend a year in Luton and tell us all of this .
Besides , it 's funny how you talk about America like it 's improved lately .
It 's going down the toilet ........... even more so by the day .
Also , in reality , it 's not mixed at all .
I promise you that Obama is an anomaly .
Most of America is about as mixed race as Roy Chubby Brown .
You mostly get concentrated ghettos with black people and then entire states full of white people .
Obama is n't representative of anything .
As for Blair , he only welcomed all these new people because not him nor his mates have to live with them .
What do they care if you get new Peckhams / Broadwater Farms in other places ?
I think immigration levels are high , and our past pm 's like gordon brown think that talking about high immigration is bigoted .
i have to say i disagree .
my father comes from an immigrant background , and i dont think am bigoted for wanting to see lower immigration levels .
i also think its stupid that our european friends can immigrate to britian and seek benefits , and denying them that would be against " human rights " .... according to the eu court of human rights .
Am i racist and bigoted for these views ?
No , saying that immigration levels are high is an observation and wanting lower immigration levels is what many people want
Everybody knows the rate of immigration is too high but it 's not really what you say , just how you say it .
Your beliefs do n't stem from believing your race is superior , or that immigrants or other races are inferior , but ' your racism ' is arguable in regards to prejudice , discrimination and antagonism ( also part of racism ) .
Not saying that you are , I am saying that is open to question and has grounds depending on how you go about these beliefs .
For example , if you made an unjust distinction of someone because they are an immigrant , not quite sure if that would make you a fully fledged racist , but it certainly would be discrimination .
Basically there is a thin line .
Sucks but life is sometimes politically correct , but you have to learn to deal with it because you never know when you 're the one going to be on the other side of the spectrum .
OK , so I am still learning about how the free market / global energy supply system works so please correct me if I am wrong , but here is my suggestion ;
All state services including social housing , libraries , hospitals , schools , prisons etc should be powered by British energy only and everything the state uses ( construction materials , food etc ) should be British produced , grown and maintained by a British workforce .
Alongside this , we open up the private sector to imports and freedom of choice , luxuries etc.
The private sector can do pretty much whatever it wants but the state must be able to support itself with or without the boom and bust of the private sector .
People who choose to live on benefits ( rely on the state ) will only have access to British resources also .
( British grown ) food will be provided for survival as will housing and energy but ( imported ) luxuries will not be available to those dependent on the state .
If people desire luxury , then they must work for it .
The idea being that the state pays ( modest ) salaries for its workers who consume British energy ( retrieving this money through taxes from British workers ) and British food / materials .
This would effectively create a system which circulated resources within the country rather than it being channelled out into the hands of Russian billionaires .
The energy will be supplied through wind turbines positioned offshore around the British isles which are maintained by idle military personnel .
Further , a production workforce will be employed by the State in factories to produce said materials .
Edit : Why is everyone negging me ?
I 'm trying to offer a solution to a problem .
And this will be paid for with what ?
So no library books from non - British authors ?
I think that demonstrates how quickly this idea is a fail .
Also not too sure why you do n't think pensioners should be allowed to buy themselves a bottle of champagne for their 80th birthday party either .
That sounds like an awful lot of Government intervention .
Your ideas are crazy and would mean the death of the free market .
You have to let the free market work .
And then consider the burden on the tax payer ....
The market should decide ,
if the people want British goods they will buy British goods .
If they want foreign goods they will buy those instead ,
it certainly is n't in the States interest to increase costs substantially by going exclusively for British goods of all kinds ,
they should go for the cheapest best quality goods instead .
This is not a dictatorship .
You can not force suppliers to sell products for no profit
( they would simply move abroad where they can sell 100 % of their product at a profit ) .
Thorium is a viable nuclear alternative and one which frankly we should already be adopting .
There are aspects of self reliance which would be good but on the whole protectionism is not a good long term policy to follow .
I 've really never understood this mentality .
Here 's the crucial fact : we import more FROM other EU member states than we export TO them .
Any tariffs they impose would hurt French , German , Spanish and Italian businesses more than it would hurt us .
The EU is fundamentally committed ( this is stated in one of its treaties I believe ) to fostering good relations and free trade with non - members , especially those which maintain high standards of human rights and democracy ( now ai n't that ironic ) .
So if we left the EU , we could negotiate free trade agreements individually with the union and its members ; we could join / remain in the EEC ; or we could join the EFTA ( EEC - lite ) .
We 'd have a range of options , all of which would keep our trade with Europe strong and healthy .
Will politicians in Germany and France want to stop Brits from buying up their countries ' BMWs , Mercs , Audis , VWs , Peugeots , Renaults , and so on ?
I very highly doubt it - not a vote - winner .
As well as maintaining our trade levels , if we left the EU we could save the several billion pounds we donate to the EU each year , reduce immigration to more viable levels , and shun some of the more overbearing aspects of EU bureaucracy , all of which would benefit our economy substantially .
Oh , and I forgot to mention that it 's predicted that the EU 's share of world trade and prosperity is going to massively decline over the coming decades .
So why is everyone terrified of leaving because of trade ?
The EU probably deflects as much trade as it creates .
Because we are part of the EU we trade more with members of the EU , such as Germany , France , Italy , Spain , Portugal , Greece and Ireland because we have a common market .
However what this means is that we trade less with nations like China , Brazil , India , Japan and America .
I am not convinced we want to attatch ourselves to the overly indebted nations of Europe .
I would rather trade with the up and coming emerging economies .
However as part of the EU you do get the appreciable benefit of free trade within the EU area .
However it is starting to look like the members of the monetary union are going to try and exploit the common market member ones eg. The Tobin Tax .
In the very long run I think being outside of Europe and trading with the emerging economies , which will eventually become the big economies , is wiser .
I agree with the Europhiles that it 's important to trade and work together so the people of Europe can collectively raise their standard of living , it 's just that the EU has proven to be a corrupt power hungry entity that has a socialist doctrine at it 's core so it 's not an ideal long term trading partner .
It 'd be like relying on the USSR to provide you with economic stability .
I need reasons for why drugs should NOT be legalised , any help please ?
i 'm for drug legalisation .
The Government has absolutely no right to say what I can and ca n't do with my body , as well as what I put in it .
We should be helping those who use drugs , not punishing them .
You could make the point that by making drugs legal and creating potentially a bigger market for their use that food crops could be replaced in developing countries for drug crops much like the increase of demand for bio fuel has done , thus increasing food prices making impoverished people even poorer and increasing inflation of food products which are bad for most consumers so drugs actually have a massive impact on none drug users !
The problem with both of us is that neither of us specified which drugs we are talking about .
Some drugs such as heroin are clearly awful - I certainly hope that you agree it is addictive and does harm others .
Some drugs have much less of a negative effect on the individual and other people around them .
Cannabis being mentally addictive is still addiction .
The addiction may very well be weaker .
I agree , the government should help drug addicts .
I believe that drug addicts should be forced to enrol on some sort of a program which is created to help them whether that would be in prison or otherwise .
( I also believe that smoking should be banned )
I think we 're all for legalizing drugs until you meet the poor guys / gals who are n't from middle class / higher class families and ca n't afford rehab ( this coming from a lower - middle class guy ) who are sleeping on the streets in the winter in the snow before eventually dying .
Drugs are n't good and are n't necessary , and ruin tons of peoples lives .
I have used drugs in the past and will probably do so sometime in the future , but it should n't be legalized .
Everybody seems to forget about you know , the large amount of money spent in hospitals treating drug users .
Besides this , saying the government should n't tell us what to do , well I hate every single politician , but using that arguement just makes people sound like children .
Perhaps reform , with more punishment on drug dealers would be good .
If you want to get philosophical , I will tell you what I believe to be the most detrimental effect of any recreational drug .
Recreational drugs cause euphoria .
Hence , drugs are an artificial substitute for a natural incentive that has evolved to motivate our species to do what necessary for it 's survival .
There are natural states in which humans can experience these sensations .
We come with built in mechanisms which produce these affects when appropriate .
This is ultimately why your body may produce some version of these chemicals naturally .
These chemical reactions are usually triggered by behaviors which are positive in terms of species propagation .
An example of such behaviors would be accomplishing a task , or making a personal connection with another .
Recreational drugs are a waste because it is counter productive to nature , to society , and to your personal growth to have access to undeserved bliss .
If we were capable of producing a drug which induced intense euphoria , with no side effects , no adverse health risks , and was infinitely available , It would be catastrophic to our society .
It is easy for drug users to delude themselves into believing that the health risks are minimal when they are partying and having so much fun .
The biggest delusion of all is the one that most overlook .
We are not naturally meant to feel that good without achieving something to improve our existence .
I already know the kinds of responses I 'm going to get to this thread , almost by definition , because as far as I can tell you can split the English public into two groups when it comes to Scottish independence ; a majority who do n't care above some vague notion that Scotland probably costs them money , and a very vocal swivel eyed unionist minority for whom Scottish independence marks the beginning of the end of their pseudo - colonial ambitions .
So I want to ask that crowd , and I already know they are going to be chomping at the bit to just click reply already , but I specifically want to know what it is you want out of the Union ; I do n't want to hear about how Scotland would be worse off somehow etc. etc. just why you want the UK to remain the UK and not split .
Does it actually boil down to anything other than a perceived loss of prestige , the final nail in the coffin of Britannia ?
I 'm English .
I think it would be nice if we stayed unionised and strong .
But really , if Scotland really wants out , then let them * * * * off , because the whole point in such a union ( IMO ) is that it 's voluntary and agreeable to all parties .
Scotland should remain as part of the union .
It serves nobody to break up one of the world 's oldest nation states .
All of the SNP 's gripes can be solved by greater localisation - not by a pointless break up .
As for ' English people ' - the attitude generally seems to be one of ' let the scots decide , but I would be sad to see the United Kingdom dismantled . '
Personally , I think it 's best to let the Scots have their independence within 5 years , but before such plans are published we should drill for all the oil they have and use it to pay off our debts .
After that if there are any remaining debts they should be given around 1/3 of it .
As I was writing a post in another topic earlier about Russia and their right to be a superpower , my mind rambled a bit and I started to wonder if Great Britain can ever become a political superpower on the international stage again .
90 years ago , the British Empire was accountable for approximately 25 % of the entire worlds population , and Britain had control of 25 % of the worlds landmass , therefore being able to completely dictate trade routes and international relations .
A lot has changed in 90 years , clearly .
In 2008 , Great Britian controls very little in the way of overseas territories , and have a population of only 58,000,000 residents , many having moved into the UK from other countries .
We also seem to be losing the ability to defend ourselves politically , being subservient to the United States in their quest to capture resources , and being a part of the European Union , often have to accept group decisions that the country does not agree with or benefit from in any way .
So , with all this in mind , can Britain ever become a superpower again if desired ?
I know that we clearly will never compete with China in terms of population , but is there any way to maximise the economic power of the nation in order to compete in terms of financial position and ability to develop and expand faster and more sustainably than other nations ?
Also , what would be the positives and negatives for the general population if it ever were to happen ?
You could make a case for the UK being a financial superpower , we punch way above our weight politically and we have one of the best trained militaries in the world .
Yet superpower in the old sense of the word , basically being a colonial or military superpower , is something I think is out of our reach for very obvious and in my opinion desirable reasons .
The best way the UK can stay on the world stage is doing what it does now , being pretty much the top in the service industries .
The British Empire was probably the greatest the world has ever known .
It was also one of the most brutal and morally abhorrent .
I think monopolistic power tends to corrupt and is almost invariably abused .
Anyway , we are a stable , wealthy country .
Why do you care , Ian ?
I hope this is n't some jingoist nonsense .
The fact is , it is n't going to happen .
Yes it can .
Whether it does become one remains to be seen .
The next superpowers will be those who win the energy war .
That is those who develop the best and most efficient renewable / readily accessible power source and are completely self sufficient on it .
Possibly creating a surplus .
In all honesty , I really see the EU being the next World Super Power in the next 70 years .
I mean we are getting closer and closer to becoming a single ' state ' .
I mean most of Europe has the same currency , laws and you do n't need a visa to travel between each country .
The numerous train operating companies in Britain make our rail system confusing .
They encourage high fares so that they can make profit , but do very little to invest in the network ultimatly leaving Britain with the highest rail fares in Europe with one of the poorest services .
Meanwhile , in other European countries such as France and Germany , the rail network is nationalised .
They benefit from low fares and quaility services composed of many ' high speed ' routes .
Privatisation in Britain was supposed to encourage competition and therefore drive drown fares but I do n't see how competition on the railways works as each company usually has a monopoly on the route they serve
( Eg. If you want to go from Nottingham to London you can only use the East midlands Trains )
So , do you think that we should re - nationalise the railways and base the network on the French - German model of low fares and high quality ? I certainly do !
We ca n't afford it right now .
Anyway if we had the money yes . Not this idiotic subsidized monopoly
What happened to that company that walked away from one of it 's franchises a couple years back ?
I remember the government ( Lord Adonis I think ) said it was going to be punished , did anything ever happen ?
Financially it may not be viable at present , but nationalisation ought to be a long term aim .
Privatising the railways was arguably the worst thing the Tories did .
In the meantime we need more regulation , especially with regards to fares , which are disgracefully high .
I support deregulation , and I am completely opposed to nationalisation .
in a time of economic downturn , you want to nationalise the rail network so the public sector ( who is already faced with billions of pounds worth of cuts ) has to finance the entire network , including maintenance , investment and subsidies ? No thanks !
Deregulation or Privatisation FTW ..... or even just how it is right now .... our rail network is n't that bad to be brutally honest ,
it gets you from A to B , sure there might be a few delays before you get to C , but you 'll get there in the end
... and the Tories are hopping mad over it !
How long can Cameron keep smoothing the ruffled feathers of his party ?
Will this be the straw that breaks the coalition 's back ?
Cleggy Weggy claims a lot of things .
It was n't really a Lib Dem victory , the general population was wholly against it from the beginning .
Nick should stick to weeping to Celine Dion .
So we 've all been hearing a lot about super - injunctions being littered all over the news , although one thing has struck me , that applies in almost all other European countries apart from us : The defendant is always anonymous until proven guilty .
I think that until the defendant is proven to be guilty , they should be completely anonymous , to prevent false arrests getting out into public and denting one 's reputation , as it is almost a form of defamation .
I do n't think it 's fair that cases are so publicized , and should only be so open if the defendant does n't mind .
It is weird how people proven to be innocent are still hated because of the accused crime , like the stigma of being called a paedophile even though it can literally happen to anyone and everyone .
Would help if the media made a big thing about them being innocent , but most people are stupid generally , else this problem would not exist .
If you look at that Joanna Yeates case , everyone had decided that landlord was guilty up to the point where people hated him and the media was slaughtering him .
Turns out he was innocent .
Not that the media owed him an apology or anything
FPTP or AV ?
Supporters of each claim that the other will benefit " x - treemists like da BNP " , but they ca n't both be right .
Can we find out here which voting system will benefit ( increase the power enjoyed by ) small , " extreme " parties like the BNP and Greens , with an explanation ?
Do n't vote for AV because you think it will help one party more than another .
Vote for AV because you think it will be more fair . If AV results in more BNP MPs , because more people in our country support the BNP , I think that 's fair enough .
We live in a democracy after all , people should be allowed to vote for who they like and everyone 's vote should count .
Honestly I hate these freaking ' Vote AV and the Tories wo n't get in ! ' arguments , they 're so idiotic and not even true .
UK peoples - Who else here thinks we should use the Single Transferable Vote as our electoral system ?
For those of you who do n't know what it is , I think STV is the main truly proportional system of electing MPs .
Candidates are numbered similar to AV , but constituencies are multi - member so seats are allocated based on numbers of votes .
It 's the system used in EU elections .
I 'm one of the few British tories who thinks we should use it , but what do you think ?
STV would be my ideal electoral system .
The whole constituency link issue would be less important if we had more localised politics .
I was sympathetic to STV , but then it seems that in the recent Irish elections it 's just as vulnerable to disproportionalities as FPTP ...
Stv is far and above the most fair system in my opinion .
Representative + constituency link maintained .
What more could you ask for !
Invade Libya .
Think about it , what does Britain have that there is a potentially lucrative demand for ?
The answer , a well trained and heavily equipped military , which although short on numbers at the moment , could easily be bolstered in a very short period of time .
The Libyan rebels are crying out for assistance in overthrowing Gadaffi , so I say we make them an offer .
We 'll send an army of 100,000 troops to take Tripoli , and in return they will provide us with a promise of a fee - say , 30 % of all Libyan oil revenue for the next 15 years .
So not only will the invasion create British jobs , take people off the streets , provide invaluable battle - field experience and be self - financing .... it could actually be PROFIT MAKING !
A 30 % stake of ALL Libyan oil revenue over the next 15 years could be worth tens of billions of pounds .
It 's just a shame that with Clegg and the Lib Dems in a position of power , this left - wing / anti - military coalition would never go for it .
BP and such British companies are already in Libya and have been for years .
Drastic action like you suggest will just form a beacon for all extremeists in Africa to come to Libya to kill British citizens
100,000 troops There 's barely that many soldiers and officers in the entire army , most of whom are not frontline but rather logistics , intelligence , engineering personnel and so forth .
You 'd have to start giving sailors and aircrew rifles and combat gear .
We are doing enough as it is in Libya , anything further we can do must be humanitarian ( supplying medical and food supplies to Misrata , for example ) or logistical ( supplying training and weapons to the rebels in Ajdabiya so they stop sucking )
OP I think you underestimate how long it would take to train and equip 100,000 soldiers then all the logistics and other such things that an army would need .
If you are going to do it well I 'd say at least 5 to 10 years .
Especially if you are doing it to the standard of the British army .
I 'm not insulting politicians here ; I 'm defending them for once .
I always feel that people are impossible to please when it comes to how politicians appear in public .
Take the TV debates for example : everyone hated Dave 's " down with the people " and " I met a black man the other day ... " act , but at the same time , had he remained aloof and failed to engage with anyone , he would have aggravated another group of people , and been called a toff even more .
Another example is that recent departure lounge picture , which everyone decried as a fake .
Again , it 's a lose lose situation : some say it was staged publicity , which is bad ; others say it was genuine , but the whole holiday was a pathetic attempt to pretend that " we 're all in it together " ; others still would doubtless complain if Dave flew off first class to a five star resort instead of using Ryanair to go to some four star place in Spain ( or wherever it was ) .
This is n't unique to the Tories , those were just the examples which sprang to mind .
Sometimes I find satire a bit annoying , because it means that politicians can never seem to do anything right .
I wish people would keep the debate on policies and ability / desire to deliver them , not who 's a toff or who 's flying which airline or holidaying in which place , or using certain mannerisms to respond to questions .
Just my random ranting two cents .
Yep , I feel extremely sympathetic to politicans .
I know quite a few personally and almost all of them are actually , dispite the hype , really good people !
They get held to a higher standard than almost anyone else , seem loathed for doing a very , very tough job and often for doing what people claim they want them to do ...
Well , you know , I doubt whether some of these " hard working " politicians would last very long if they had to work on a building site carrying bricks or steel gurders for 10 hours a day , or even work a 9-5 carrying heavy frozen meat produce from one cage to another 7 days a week .
I 'm sick and tired of this wishy washy social justice nonsense that the Lib Dems are inflicting on Her Majesty 's Government .
What the country needs is a Tory government .
A proper Tory government that will not be afraid to stand up for free markets , hard work , Britishness , Israel and our military .
I hope to God the AV referendum returns a big fat NO so that this horrid left wing coalition can be returned to the dust and we can finally get on with real , Tory leadership ( thanks to First Past The Post , of course ) .
What has first past the post got to do with having a Tory government ?
The problem for the Tories is n't the electoral system its that they do n't have enough widespread support in the electorate .
We had first past the post last time , the country was on its knees and we had had 13 years of Labour government , with Labour 's popularity at rock bottom .
But still the Tories did n't have enough support to get a majority under FPTP .
Now the Tories are facing the unpopularity of government and Labour are ahead on the opinion polls .
The Lib Dem vote will collapse but I bet more of their vote goes to Labour / Greens than it does the Tories .
I think the UK was a broadly Tory nation up till the 1990s but since then it has turned against them , they had their lowest ever days in the mid - late 1990s and early 2000s , even since they 've had an upturn on the back of a Labour government running into problems , they 've not been able to build a broad base of support in the country like MacMillan or Thatcher did .
The tories did n't get a majority because labour fixed the boundries .
Labour got a majority in 2005 with 9.6 million votes but the tories come short in 2010 despite having 1.1 million more votes than this .
Some analyst reckon the tories needed just another 15,000 votes to get that majority .
I would have voted based on what I thought was best for the country .
If I honestly thought Labour could solve the problem , despite all my problems with them , I would have voted Labour .
But that is n't the case .
But a lot of Labour voters I know / have met , have told me that they vote Labour because ' Tories only care about the rich ' .
And that is it , you ask them why they think that and .... nothing .
Or another common reason ' Tories will take away EMA and give the moeny to the rich ' .
Well yes , they took away EMA , but EMA was a stupid system anyway , unfair and put in place by the Labour government to try and make unemployment figures look better .
Most Labour voters I know in real life voted for them either out of ignorance and views inherited from their parents / peers .
Or because they wanted their pocket directly lined .
Now , I know this is n't the case for all Labour voters , hell there are some intelligent ones on TSR , who vote for Labour for decent reasons , and though I disagree I respect them for that .
I just feel that Labour get a lot of votes from the reverse - snob working class in areas like mine .
So they can quite literally do anything , and people will still vote for them over the Tories .
I 'm fairly right wing , but I do n't think a full on tory government is what anyone wants .
This is a centrist country and the government should reflect that .
I 'd like it if we elected very socially liberal governments all the time ( to the point of legalising and taxing all narcotics ) , but I know that wo n't happen .
I 'd like withdrawl from the EU , but that wo n't happen .
Politics in most democratic countries does usually hover around the centre .
Apart from the US , but that 's a cultural thing really .
As a Labour Party supporter , I disagree with the cuts that the Coalition Government are currently making .
They are going too far , too fast .
Their policy of contractionary fiscal policy creates a substantial risk of the UK slipping back into recession , which means consumer confidence will begin to fall even further , as people will be more likely to save , which leads to less money being pumped into the economy , ie . a fall in aggregate demand .
With current levels of unemployment very high , job losses will be the consequence of these harsh , unnecessary cuts through the Coalition Government 's contractionary fiscal policy .
On the other hand , Labour 's policy of expansionary fiscal policy means that although the budget deficit will increase , a significant number of jobs will be created , aggregate demand will increase , which means an increase in consumer confidence , therefore household income will increase , which may result in taxpayers moving into a higher tax band , which leads to an increase in Government revenue from taxation .
If we carry on with the current rate of cuts , we will reverse to the 1980 's , making the poorest poorer , and the richest richer , same old Tories !
Cuts need to be made at a steady pace , with the budget deficit dealt with once the economy is full steam ahead .
All views , opinions and thoughts are more than welcome
Definately pro - cuts , even though the wife lost her job , she still agrees with the cuts , it 's for the good of the country as a whole
Pro cuts for me to because if you invest in the public sector like labour would it means your getting growth based on debt which doesnt work then we 'll eventually have the same problem again and run out of other peoples money to spend .
The only way you can have growth is by private investment .
I 'm not against the cuts per se .
I 'm just against the reforms that are going to cost as much to implement as they save and are done for ideological rather than financial reasons .
Cuts are more or less inevitable , even if I do n't necessarily agree with what , when , where , how and why .
It makes me cringe that the government are cutting funding for the British people , and yet somehow fund the military to rain clusters of bombs over foreign people !
to be honest as much as everyone dislikes them I do n't see any other political parties putting forward a decent proposal
this country literally has no money and is in huge amounts of debt
I 'm against the increase in Uni fees though , on the whole I do realise that University fees DO have to increase , but trebling them within the space of a year is far too much
I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread , but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter .
I 'm a British Pakistani , born and brought up in London , however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side .
Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan ' Do n't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan ' , made a few years ago , yet a very interesting watch .
I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times , and have traveled throughout the country , so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it 's people .
However , after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked .
I may be wrong when I say this , but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state , yet only 64 years on and I do n't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with .
It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture , in a sense it boosts their superiority complex .
I actually find it shocking , that most families who moved to England in the 60 's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan .
Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting , it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction - the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further .
Also whilst I 'm on this topic , has anyone seen the film ' Slackistan ' and what were your views ?
Thank for reading my thoughts !
Liberalization is moving in the OPPOSITE direction ?
Personally , any nation 's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the 21st century .
While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled , ever since the fall of the wall in 1989 , Liberal democratic values have spread ( End of History , Fukuyama , 1992 ) and that does not preclude ( just yet ) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law .
Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire ( as long as it does n't harm anybody else ) .
I think it is the right direction that Western culture ( unforced ) is spreading , it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact , promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life .
I do n't see that being a problem .
And that 's a bad thing why ?
Westernisation = Progress .
Imitating the most developed countries in the world is n't really a bad thing .
Pakistan was founded on the basis that Muslims felt their interests would not be guarded by a Hindu government , not as some spiritual Muslim homeland .
As it is , I 'd hardly say Pakistan is ' Western ' , what with it 's blasphemy laws , it 's constant conflict with India , conservative populace , tacit funding and support for various Islamist organisations .
I think rather than worrying about the populace , worry about yourself .
Who are you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol , or watch Western TV ?
Also , as you bemoan the West . It 's worth remembering you would n't have had a country without us
I simply do n't get why Iran is such a huge threat .
They are merely retaliating to whatever our politicians throw at them !
" If Iran changes course , abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions , and lives up to its international obligations , it will be welcomed back into the community of nations . " ...
As a weak country with no big weapons to defend its people ..
Yeh right , they 're so on board with that !
All the huge countries that are bullying Iran into submission right now with sanctions and what not have nuclear weapons ?
How on earth is this fair ?
All the sanctions is AFFECTING ORDINARY IRANIANS !
Soaring food prices / Fuel ...
Why is the world doing nothing ? !
Do we want Iran to become the next North Korea ?
This is totally Unacceptable !
Not to mention the meddling we have been doing inside Iran for the past 100 years or so ... installing the shah .. overthrowing democratic governments ...
Hey Israel , how about you assassinate some more Iranian scientists ?
Absolutely degrading behaviour by the west , no wonder they hate us !
Because they have a pretty crazy guy at the head of their goverment - who 's developing nuclear weapons .
Not to mention the grudge they have against the west .
they have a bad history of blowing things / people they dont like up ...
negs , quaint ... are you all disputing irans known history of terrorism or are you all morons ?
Because Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a maniac .
What kind of history do the US have then ?
Dont remember Iran starting a war the last .. lets say 2500 years ?
that was a tongue in cheek remark i wasnt being entirely serious .
Largely rhetoric to lay the groundwork to get support for the war .
This was n't done properly before going to war in Iraq and we had people opposed to it from the start , also going in with mixed messages ' its about WMD and a bit about regime change ' looked bad when there were n't any WMD there .
So we need to go in from the start saying with Iran it 's about regime change , Ahmedinijad is bad , he does n't respect womens rights or whatever otherwise you will have the same situation if we say its about nuclear weapons and then go to war and do n't find any nuclear weapons .
I can understand the argument that nuclear proliferation is bad and any of these states having nuclear weapons is not desirable as it just leads to proliferation in the region , but that argument should have been used against Pakistan and Israel getting nukes .
People say Iran having nukes is a risk because terrorists might be able to get hold of nuclear material ...
well hello ... Pakistan has them .
Remember when we went in to take out Bin Laden we could n't tell the Pakistani government for fear that Bin Laden would have been tipped off and escaped ...
that hardly fills me with confidence that they should be allowed to have nuclear weapons .
The problem with these ' resolutions ' targeting Iran is that everyone can see the hypocrisy , its a case of our allies can have nukes but others ca n't .
A much better resolution would have been a hard resolution on non proliferation and disarmament in the region , which meant India and Pakistan had to disarm and Israel had to disarm , and any moves by any country in the region towards getting nuclear weapons would be met by international air strikes .
I could definitely support that as a non proliferation treaty .
I 've heard stories of Pakistanis , Indians , Bengalis , Filipinos , Iranians and Arabs with African roots being racially abused in places like Saudi Arabia , UAE , Bahrain and so on ...
Are you a non - Arab minority living in the Middle - East , or do you know someone who did ?
Do you feel that the problem of racism is a big or a small one in comparison to places like America ( the southern states in particular ) ?
It 's not so much racist , as it is ' classist ' .
People from India , Pakistan , and so on often work as maids , drivers , etc. in the middle east .
They do n't abuse you because you 're a certain skin color , they abuse you because they think you 're some servant that barely makes any money and should be grateful for being there .
Yes , there is racism in some Arab countries in the Middle East .
If you are from Pakistan , India , Bangladesh or any country that is n't very rich then you are mostly treated like crap .
However , if you are British , or from the US or any other rich European country then they treat you really well .
Indians in particular are treated badly , there are Indian maids and they are often hit by the house wife if they for example make a small mistake or sometimes they are hit with no reason .
I have relatives who live in one of those rich middle eastern countries and as far as I know they told me that some of them whilst at School have experienced racisms from children for example one of them a girl was called black and ugly and that her hair is bad but the teachers do n't do anything about it , they are racist themselves .
I have to admit I am really quite worried about Russia ..
In the mainstream media and popular consciousness the big doomsday scenarios mainly centre around Iran and China , obviously both of those are grossly misrepresented , the idea of a US - Chinese war for example is objectively absurd and no serious commentators pay it any attention , it 's really just a propaganda tool and an exciting subject for video games .
The situation in Iran has the ability to cause a lot of misery in the middle east but again , Iranian leaders are really quite self aware , they know what they are doing , and there is near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapons of them actually using them , although we as simple peasants obviously need to believe that and go along with our governments because if Iran does become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously ca n't be tolerated .
Anyway , Russia , it seems to me , is the real potential doomsday scenario here .
Almost all the conditions of wiemar Germany are present ; economic downturn , unemployment , a recent history of loss of empire , rising nationalism and xenophobia .
And just like Germany there is a hard turn to the far right by the country 's middle classes and the rise of egomaniacal leaders who are already undermining what little democracy there has been in Russia .
There are even Putin youth leagues harassing opponents above the law .
You have the ultra nationalist and deeply racist cossack tribes , highly militant , extremely aggressive and becoming more and more mobilised , convinced that the time has come for mother Russia and that x , y and z ethnic / religion / political groups are responsible for the loss of Russia 's glory and therefore must be eliminated .
Just like Germany was , Russia still is a major military power , a nuclear one , and with enormous economic potential .
Honestly when you think about it it really does look just .. terrifying .
Am I missing something here ?
Can anyone explain further or recommend some reading ?
Yes , Russia does have huge problems with neo - nazi ideology ( which is kind of ironic given the history of Russia ) .
It 's military is pretty brutal as well - see Chechnya .
Russia regularly interferes in it 's neighbours ( such as the Ukraine and the invasion of Georgia when it became too western ) , but I do n't think it has much power beyond that , that is n't to say that they would n't if they could .
But they are hemmed in by China , Europe and the United States .
There is a lot of bitterness about how ex - USSR states have become part of ' The West ' ( like Poland and Estonia for example ) .
What specifically are you concerned about ?
It is n't going to invade Europe again if that 's what you are concerned about .
I mean they helped the invasion of Afghanistan and Putin asked to join NATO .
Their closest " Western " allies are France and Italy ( and they are close ) .
Russia is n't really that close to any major powers .
I disagree with this , at least not without huge structural changes .
It has terrible future demographics ( with no available fix through immigration ) and is totally dependent on exporting oil and gas - as well as being run by corrupt oligarchs ( who make Western corporatism look non - corrupt and benevolent ) .
I think Russia is pretty neutral about most international affairs now , so I do n't see the big worry .
Russia has been reduced to nothing but a peripheral country that condemns whatever resolution the West puts forward .
The Russian government is pretty bad , but their opposition is worse .
The leader of the second largest party in Russia , the communist party , wants Russia to be " re - Stalinised " .
The third largest party , the Liberal Democrats , is pretty nutty too .
First off , a disclaimer of sorts , these are my opinions based on news reports and a little research around the topic so I apologise if my facts are wrong or inaccurate .
Like the title says I welcome thoughts either on my opinion , or on the matter in question .
Anyone who follows the news will have heard in amidst all the " EU crisis " there is an issue growing between the west and the middle east .
Specifically Iran and its attempt at a nuclear program , where Iran hopes to gain nuclear power for peaceful purposes ( Iran 's statement ) .
The US and EU however believe that Iran are using this nuclear program to develop and obtain nuclear weapons claiming they have " information suggesting Iran had carried out tests relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device " .
Due to this the US and EU have imposed sanctions on Iran involving limits on the oil bought from Iran which in turn decreases their economy and other sanctions of similar consequences .
Right now that that 's done I can state my opinion , please correct anything I have put that is wrong !
My opinion in short is this , the US and EU have no right to impose sanctions on Iran and to deter their nuclear program .
HOWEVER , I am very opposed to Iran gaining nuclear weapons and threatening WW 3 and in fact I am opposed to any country having nuclear weapons .
The only argument the US and EU have is that Iran is not a stable country at the moment and a unstable country should n't be able to kill millions at the touch of a button .
However for them to tell another country what they ca n't have , when they have nuclear weapons themselves is nothing except hypocrisy .
From Iran 's point of view , one could argue that our governments are unstable with new leaders every 4 years with differing opinions and views .
What right do we have to dictate what another country can and can not do .
I think that 's the essence of my argument , and I accept that the " Iran instability " is a big part of the sanctions .
Thank you for reading and I hope I 'm not completely ignorant here !
Why do countries not have a right to tell others what to do ?
People tell each other what to do all day every day , why should countries be exempt ?
Of course , Iran has every right to say " no " , but then those other countries have every right to refuse to trade with them .
Though I do n't believe we should have nuclear weapons either - it 's not hypocritical as such .
Having a new leader every 4 years does n't make a country unstable ( otherwise Irans single leader would be highly stable ) .
Most countries who have nuclear weapons now can be trusted not to abuse them - Iran can not .
Regardless , I personally do n't think world security should be held back just because someone is worried about being a bit hypocritical .
I believe that the only reason why American gun sights have been trained on Iran is because of their decision to switch from petro - dollars ( American ) to the gold standard or something similar .
This would would have a detrimental effect on the American economy , or practically any economy that relies on the dollar as a currency and as a result , the already weak American economy would lose it 's leading place .
All the other aspects , nuclear power and oppressive regimes are just a side issue .
This was demonstrated time and time again when Saddam switched to Euros in 2000 and Gaddafi wanted to switch to the gold standard before he was toppled .
The EU also wanted something similar and I do n't know what happened to that .
There is still no evidence against Iran .
The IAEA have been in many times .
All we have is suspicions .
Also the IAEA publishing the names of all Iraqi nuclear scientists is rather sinister .
They very well knew this is like gold dust to Israel and America ie assassination targets . Impartiality ?
I think not .
The hypocrisy argument gets nowhere , but most fail to understand the double standards suggest an ulterior motive , at the least a lack in credibility of the West .
Israel has illegally obtained and continues to have a nuclear arsenal , not to mention the innumerable UN violations against it 's neighbours , yet it is metaphorically Scot free to do as it pleases .
It 's like they are playing Poker : The Political leadership of Israel / US and Iran seem to me more likely to " go all in " rather than back down and fold or negotiate .
I think it 's a while off yet .
Iran is having a decent time trading with the East , and trying to stick two fingers up to the West .
Neither side want 's to jepordise their economic security by engaging in what will be a costly and deadly military action .
I think the only problems will come if and when Iran stop allowing Nuclear inspections , or when the UN / NATO / the West decide that there is a high probability that Iran are near realisation of weaponised nulcear material .
I personally find Russia 's behaviour at the UN this week to be absolutely disgusting .
Apparently they 're threatening to veto a resolution on Syria if it does not explicitly rule out foreign military intervention .
The text has already been ' watered down ' to omit the demand that Assad step down , yet again to appease the Kremlin .
Every day nearly 100 innocent civilians are being massacred by the fascist government in Syria ( at a far quicker rate than those Palestinians who have died at the hands of Israel ) .
But where are the demonstrations ?
Where are the ' blood for oil ' and ' victory to the intifada ' morons ?
Where are the hysterical students comparing Medvedev to Hitler and Assad to an SS commandant ?
Where are the Russian flags being displayed next to swastikas ?
Where is Michael Moore 's film condemning these indiscriminate murders ?
Where 's the public outcry about Russian veto and unilateralism ( a criticism routinely employed - rightly - against the United States when it vetoes resolutions on Israeli aggression ) ?
So many have been killed that the UN has given up trying to count casualties , and yet we have a clique of barbarians and mafia crooks in Moscow holding the world hostage over this issue .
Russia is renovating a military base in Syria , has arms deals worth billions , infrastructure and energy deals .
Russian oil , gas and steel companies have substantial interests in Syria including an Arab gas pipeline , gas processing plant , deal with national syrian oil company and oil exploration there .
Russia wants stability and a friendly regime to ensure the security of their interests , so they back Assad .
That 's Russia for you .
Nevertheless , Assad would be lucky if he survived this year .
It 's a similar situation to Libya .
The rebels need help with the big military targets , but when it comes to ground operations , they are more than capable of handling the situation .
If you wish to understand Russia 's reasoning , know its national interest .
In this case arms contracts worth $ 4 Billion is a national interest .
No way are they going to let that go down the drain if they can do something about it .
Nor are they willing to lose face by openly supporting the Syrian regime .
They will just exercise their UN privileges and keep sneaking the promised weapons into Syria one way or the other and keep cashing in on the opportunity .
Personally , I do n't think they would start WW 3 if Iran is attacked , because they have more to lose , and they 'd probably just do things like supply weapons etc. ..
Any one else have an opinion on this ?
If WW 3 does break out , we know we can go to Greenland or Egypt
Good to see China backing the Iranians .
whilst i think the prospect of ww3 is a slight bit of over kill the chinese do have a point in that the west is in no position to meddle in iranian affairs least of all at this stage
China hey dude , sup
Iran hows it goin bro
China yeh just u no how u like killin your own peeps just like I do ?
Iran yeh lol
China lets like hang out together n attack ppl who try to stop us killin our peeps
Iran sure thing bro
China would eventually lose .
Anyone , watching any of the GOP republican presidential debates , as you can see the media pathetic effort for pretending that Ron Paul does n't exist .
Ron Paul is right on every level but the mainstream media does not want him to get as much talk time as other Puppets such as Rick Santo rum and Mitt Romney
I 'm in .
He is amazing , the only person who can take the USA forward .
However , he appears to be losing steam as a result of the timing of Florida and S. Carolina .
Do you realise that Ron Paul would disapprove of the video in your sig vehemently ?
Probably , but then due to the fact it 's got more space , the USA does n't have the same problem with Muslims as Europe does .
Also , the USA 's biggest problem at the moment is an economic one .
People are saying this everywhere now and the consequences are unknow .
Could this really happen ?
Only if Ron Paul doesnt become president then there will be war .
The U.S. has n't the capacity to commit to a full - scale war with Iran at present if one keeps in mind its quite significant pre - existing commitments , the state of the economy , and the strength of Iran 's defensive capability - targeted strike ( s ) seems more likely , or perhaps greater action by Israel , but I doubt that .
Why is the United Kingdom allowing Asma Assad and her three children to remain in the UK ?
I know she was born and raised in London , but do you think that the UK is as anti - Assad as it claims ?
One word , three letters , two vowels , one consonant .
OIL
But there are sanctions on oil exports ?
I know this sounds too nice but it 's maybe because a persons family should not suffer for the ' crimes ' of an individual .
She 's British I think .
We 've been hearing a lot in the news about Iran and its threats to shut the Straight of Hormuz , and how western countries ( e.g. the UK , the USA and France ) , but how are the countries around the straight reacting to the threat ?
as I cant seem to find anything on how countries such as Oman , Iraq the UAE are reacting .
Wild speculation is welcome here
This is backwards .
It 's not a threat , it 's a response to the threats of others , e.g " Attack us and we 'll close the Strait of Hormuz " .
There is nothing for other countries to respond to .
They are the would - be aggressors .
Unfortunately most TSR'rs are too brainwashed to see that .
Just so stupid .
Iran 's the only one with the balls to stand up to Israel / USA .
IF they fall due to the surrounding countries going against them , then they 'll continue remaining sheeps and it wo n't be long till they 're toppled themselves .
I support Saudi 's arming up though , as I do for all Muslim nations , weapons may be useful in future .
The Islamic Republic only exists in part because of Israel .
Israel sold almost one billion $ of arms to the Islamic Republic during the Iran - Iraq war and provided loads of military aid ( this was while Israel was apparently a supposed sworn enemy ) , training and even helpfully removed Iraq 's nuclear capacity in Operation Opera ; where if Saddam had developed nuclear weaponry he would have undoubtedly used against Iran .
Did you know that there was a camp just outside Tehran of Israeli tacticians aiding Khomeini and co against Iraq for the whole of the conflict with Iraq ?
The Islamic Republic owes an awful lot to Israel - it enabled it to survive against Saddam and continue the war with Iraq ( by continuing the war this enabled it to solidify it 's position by killing thousands and thousands of Iranian democrats and other members of the opposition - as well as terrorising the population ) .
Do n't forget that Iran supported America when they invaded Afghanistan and Iraq as well .
These are the facts :
In the west , it is threatened by Iraq , in which US forces are still present
In the east , Afghanistan has at least 100,000 US troops alone
South - east , Pakistan which has nuclear arms , corrupt officials and is a US ally
All around are arab countries with friendly ties to the US who keep rallying for the ' head to be cut off the snake '
North - west , Turkey , Nato ally
North - east contains refuelling stations for US millitary vehicles in Turkmenistan
who is really being threatened here ?
Sorry to inform you : THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE WOULD GO TO WAR : P
As nice as it would be for countries like the USA and the UK to be over there to help , the truth is we would n't interfere if it was n't for the oil and other economic and political gains .
If they do restrict the Straight it will will cause a massive decrease in the amount of oil to the west ( 40 % of imported oil comes from the straight according to a figure I saw on the news ) , and our economy would greatly suffer ...
We would in that situation definitely cause a big commotion .
I highly doubt there would be a WW 3 , but I do know for certain that the big countries and supper powers would go to war due to globalisation and economic links .
In Australia the poor quality of local broadcaster 's international news seems to have completely baffled the general population as to exactly what is going on , the coverage is utterly appealing to be honest and regularly confuses their nuclear programs and their attempts to blockade the Straits of Homuz .
Politically the general gist of things is that the current Labor government is stuck between sucking up to the United States and therefore getting embroiled in any potential conflict ( HMAS Parramatta is presently off Somalia under NATO command and could get drafted in should military action commence ) and the fact that the Greens now have control over them through their control of the Senate and their single lower house seat ( Hung Parliaments for you ) and of course are very anti - war , anti - NATO and anti - ANZUS .
The ultimate result will be down to who is Prime Minister when such a situation occurs , according to the unions they intend to fire Gillard next month and replace her with Kevin Rudd yet again who is extremely pro - China and less aligned with the United States although he will probably suck up to Obama as well .
The opposition will attempt to counter any potential for entering the war with statements such as " They 'll be Iranian Boatpeople " causing national panic and further hatred of innocent refugees potentially leading to an early election and a Coalition ( Liberal - Nationals ) government being formed who will support the war to a degree but otherwise will be to focused on Nauru which is the main aim of their entire foreign policy .
Over these past two years , I have noticed an increasing amount of anti - Iranian news reports which have culminated in the recent attacks on the British Embassy with both countries expelling our respective Diplomats .
It now seems certain to me that within the next decade the U.K and U.S.A among others will be involved in a fully fledged war against Iran .
Throughout history , the expelling of Diplomats has usually meant one thing and when this is coupled with the Arab Spring alongside general unrest for a long period in Iran , it seems inevitable we are heading towards another war .
As a general question , I would like to ask others to see what you think ?
Are we going to war , what can we do to avoid this and just in general for people to air their opinions on another war in the Middle East .
P.S. Just to clarify I am neither anti nor pro war , this is just a launch pad for a discussion .
Given the Israeli mentality I would say we will see them strike Iran .
Would't be shocked if they used nukes either tbh
That is a big claim ,
it would quite an amazing escalation if Israel used nuclear bombs on Iran .
I know , however Israel is going to know that if they strike Iran Iran will hit back .
Conventional weapons may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facilities either .
The idea of a single debilitating strike on Iran that will stop it ever being able to strike back is going to be very very tempting for Israel .
And depending on which way the American election goes American support may not be forthcoming if someone like Ron Paul gets elected
If they have / get nukes , no one 's invading Iran .
I personally think it would be cool , Israel might have to think twice before carrying out major bombings in Palastine etc.
There will always be that deterrant if Iran gets nukes .
Of course not but the question is fast becoming not will Israel strike but when and how .
A conventional strike on Iran is going to raise massive geopolitical consequences too . Including huge damage to the world economy and the possible destruction of Israel .
bit of a novice at economics but i was wondering , after kim jong - il 's death why are the stock markets in asia / korea falling ;
are they anticipating something ? thanks
This will hopefully herald the end of socialism as we know it as people will realise that it is doomed to fail .
Just leads to insecurity in markets
you look at koreas neighbours China , South Korea etc all major players in the world economy .
Im sure some dirty bankers have vested interests also .
But whose to say it was Kim Jong bringing down the markets .
With the primaries quickly approaching I thought it would be a good idea to have a thread on everything related to the 2012 election .
Who do people think will be the Republican nominee ?
Who do you think has the best chance of beating Obama ?
For me it seems that it is going to come down to a two - way race for the nomination between Romney and Gingrich .
I ca n't see any of the others getting the nomination .
Romney probably has a better chance than Gingrich of beating Obama .
There is now a poll .
If you do n't think any of the candidates can beat Obama then that goes under ' other ' .
I personally would like to see Ron Paul be the nominee , but Backmouth probably has better chance of becoming a TSR Mod than this happening .
The republicans will probably go with Romney over Newt Gingrich .
It is a shame that scandal has hit Herman Cain because he had promise .
I am an Independent voter and my opinion is that who ever the Republican nominee is , they probably wo n't be willing to do what 's necessary for the U.S. economy if elected .
If Obama is reelected he definitely wo n't be willing to do what 's necessary for the economy .
I hope most other independents feel the same .
I 'd be happy with anyone but Obama who wants nothing less than our economy 's complete demise and is clearly anti - Israel .
What does everybody think about the possibility of going to war with Iran ?
The US are making moves encouraging a very likely chance of war !
Do you think it will happen ?
Do you think it should happen ? Discuss ...
Mark my words . No other country will attack Iran except for Israel , with perhaps military support in terms of intelligence from the US / UK.
The UK does not have the means to carry out an attack on Iran . -
Forget the fact that the US / UK / NATO would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack .
Israel ? They can do what they want .
What are people views on the current British occupation of Ireland .
Should it be freed from their imperialist grip etc. ... ?
What do you 's think of the current armed struggle ?
Was the war involving the IRA and INLA a success or a failure ?
And what are your views on those trying to establish a socialist republic in Ireland ( not the Guerilla Army 's ) ?
I really do n't think anyone in Britain cares much about Ireland .
I do n't think many people really understand why you insist on murdering each other either .
Ireland needs to overcome its grip of alcohol .
First , Britain no longer occupies the southen 26 states .
The idea of an armed struggle is preposterous , even to strong nationalists the idea of free healthcare , a stronger economy and less corrupt politics makes war even more ridiculous .
Currently those in the IRA are terrorists fighting a pointless war they 'll never win .
Socialism is in itself a fair theory for government , yet no country has established a socialist republic that is superior to the current democracy
The law of return gives Jewish people and those who half Jewish on their mother 's side the right to become Israeli citizens .
This is a ridiculous sexist and racist law that nations around the world should oppose .
Britain is now refusing to give aid to countries who discriminate against gays , we must now do the same to sexist and racist nations .
A number of states world wide have similar discrimination , however we deem Israel as a modernised civilized society .
Israel must set an example to these less developed nation by scraping this outrageous policy .
What if the government said all people of European heritage are free to become British citizens would we call them racist ?
Israel is a Jewish state , specifically .
Created for the Jewish people , does n't seem that odd that if you 're Jewish you 're allowed citizenship .
Judaism is passed through the mother ( a Jewish mother makes you a full blooded Jew , not half jewish ) that 's how Judaims works .
So it 's not that sexist per se it simply follows the Jewish laws of inheritance .
Other religions are passed soley through the father , are they sexist too ?
Making Aaliyah is n't exactly a small step ...
And as soon as you 're a citizen if you 're under 40 ( 35 for women ) you will have to join the IDF .
I just do n't think it 's that shocking or appalling .
Also , they have a very good refugee policy - they 'll take pretty much anyone who is fleeing for safety .
Countries are free to make up Immigration rules as they please .
It happens here in the U.K and around the world .
For example if my Grandfather was a British Citizen born in the U.K , who then moved and married a none British Citizen , and they then had my mother outside of the U.k , my mother would still be eligible for citizenship .
However if my mother then married a non Brit and gave birth to me outside of U.K I would no longer be eligible for citizenship as Citizenship rights only extend one generation in the Uk.
However if it were Ireland instead of the U.k I would still be eligible for Citizenship if my Grandfather was Irish .
So I would be Irish if my Grandfather was Irish , but I would not be British if my Grandfather was British .
Is this discriminatory ? Yes ..
but immigration laws by their very nature are discriminatory , that is their whole purpose , to discriminate who is and who is n't allowed into a country .
All nations have them and they all tend to be different ( which is normal considering different nations have different cultures , traditions and customs ) , it just so happens that in Israel the requirement is that your mother is / was Jewish , it is different to requirments in other countries but it is no less valid .
Reading the newspaper today you may have seen an article regarding a teenager called Tariq Aziz .
He was part of a scheme organised to document the effect of drone strikes , he was given a camera .
On his way to his aunts house he and his 12 year old cousin were slaughtered by an illegal cia drone strike .
What the * * * * is wrong with America ?
Who will go to * * * * ing court because of this ?
No - one cos its America , and they are clearly above the law because they have money .
How the * * * * can America complain about Palestinian home - made rockets when they 're using drones without a care in teh world ?
Why does America have the right to * * * * ing attack anywhere its want without any accountability ?
It 's not a bloody cod killstreak .
Why when they kill civillians do they have the cheek , to quote the Times article to say ' they 're has been no collateral damage in drone attacks ' when according to the Times again there are pictures of incinerated young children ?
Now do you understand why many people , especially muslims have a gripe against the Americans ?
At least most muslims are sane , unlike the American goverment who just ca n't seem to stop committing terrorist acts .
I 'm sorry for the swearing , i 'm not one to usually swear , but the CIA et al are a joke .
Why the negs ?
The killing of this and several other innocents is okay ?
If Iran sent a little drone to America and did the samething , what would the ramifcations be ?
what would the outcry be like .. ?
OP I suggest that you watch the documentary " Secret Pakistan " on BBC iPlayer and then come back to argue .
This supposed ally of the USA is training and preparing INNOCENT Afghan children who are too young to understand Islam properly to go into a busy Afghan bazaar to blow up INNOCENT Afghan civilians .
This is what Pakistan deserves for funding lunatic Islamic rebels since the the 1960s against any Afghan government that has existed .
It is the price paid for the two million dead Afghans during the Soviet occupation and the civil war which Porkistan funded .
The truth is , every time these drones hit , they kill maybe 10 % terrorists ( at max ) and 90 % civilians .
Each of this civilians is a real human with real emotion , not just a statistic .
For instance , a 10 year old kid sees their father blown to pieces , you expect them to love the Americans ?
They become radicalised and ready to murder Americans at any cost .
America strategically targets civilians so they have a reason to stay there due to further radicalisation of youth .
I tried to watch the program " Secret Pakistan " but the question i kept asking was why ?
In the first ten - twenty minutes they never explained why Pakistan would want to double cross .
Now do n't get me wrong there will be people within the intellilgence who are double crossing and have a secret agenda .
But to the highest level as a whole why would the government want such destabilisation from all angles .
The president is corrupt and money hungry but i would say that there are plenty of easier ways for him to do that if he so pleases and putting the country into turmoil and him in a terrible light would surely be foolish .
And re the whole drone thingn I really struggle to understand how they can be justified at all .
When lots of people in USA died in 2001 they felt angry , agrieved and wwant revenge .
To do this they went on a long war resulting in thousands of deaths and also did not take regard for countries ' sovereignty .
Now again a lot if not the majority of deaths are not caused by the USA directly but a significantly large number are therefore it is still a valid point to raise .
I would love to know how a usa citizen would react if bombs were dropped on their home towns by a foreign country .
I 'm sure they would be happy to forget it and want no justice .
You know what I love ?
All these people saying ohh , you are creating the terrorism !
Well , we would n't be doing anytyhing were it not for the terrorists in the first place .
And what cause have they ?
They did n't like American foireign policy .
So instead of going to a parliment meeting , they went to armory and decided to blow * * * * up and kill innocents .
You want someone to blame for the deaths of civilians in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan , look no further than Muslim Terrorists .
I think most people are looking at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation .
Ever since the intervention in Afghanistan and drone attacks of Pakistan , can anyone give me a successful attack by al-Qaeda on the West since the intervention ?
Some people should know better that the United States and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians , quite the contrary .
Most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that Islamic fundamentalists have been operating in Pakistan and are the root cause of terrorism in that area .
In 2006 , Pakistan saw 657 terrorist attacks leaving 907 people dead .
In 2007 , Pakistan saw 1,503 terrorist attacks , resulting in 3,448 casualties .
In 2008 , Pakistan saw 2,148 terrorists attacks , resulting in 2,267 casualties .
In 2009 , Pakistan saw 2,586 terrorist attacks , that resulted in 3,021 fatalities .
Terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people .
If we compare this to figure of civilian casualties ( which I will go into ) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed , 385 were thought to be civilians , in contrast of the Taliban / al-Qaeda 's operations to kill civilians .
Interestingly , the number of terror attacks in Pakistan dropped which can prove to be conclusive evidence of the effect on al-Qaeda and Taliban leadership and their effective operational capability that is decreasing .
One can logically say these drone attacks are working , which is reported on both sides if you look at the current fragmentation of al-Qaeda and asscoatied jihadist sects leadership operating on the Afghan - Pakistani border .
From a strategy perspective , in 2009 and 2010 , air drones were equipped with new missiles called Small Smart Weapon ( SSW ) or typically known as ' Scorpion . '
These missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance , including the use of small , unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets .
Ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , Bloomberg reports that 1,300 militants were killed and only 30 civilians killed in drone attacks in mid - 2008 .
The New America Foundation believes that civilian casaulties have decreased from 25 % to an estimated 6 % , with a total of 18 civilians killed since August 2010 .
On the grounds of legality , according to the Geneva Convention , members of regular armed forces - involved in conflicts - are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force .
The operators in Pakistan are the United States ( USAF ) and the Pakistani military .
So , who really murders more ?
Islamic fundamentalist groups total of 35,000 casualties ( since 2003 ) or the United States ' 385 casualties ( since 2004 ) ?
why ca n't people think the same thing ? if it was two american kids dad there would be media furore .
I did n't see these two kids names on the news ?
Yet we see soldiers who made a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .
Actually , it does
That is the very definition of democracy , if something passes by the tiniest fraction of a percent needed then everyone and everything else can be ignored .
Of course this is not how we work , but then you ca n't start saying we 're undemocratic because people do n't turn out for the vote , that is their problem , not the governments .
And please don ; t get started on the coalition .
It is democratic because together they recieved more votes than Labour , so they have a right to power .
Right , so to you there 's no difference in blowing up 100 's of civilians in a crowded market place , and blowing up a building but phoning the threat in beforehand to minimise civilian casualties ? In that case , it 's ok every , Bishy just basically said collaterol damage does n't exist for any Western forces as there 's no distinction between force used . Let 's start bombing civilian areas , it just does n't matter apparantly And of course , I do n't condone either group , afterall , the IRA 's aims were only achieved after they laid down their arms .
No more than it is for someone to blow you up .
there seems to be a misconception held by some that america is not a welfare state .
does anyone know the percentage of gdp they spend on welfare and benefits of all kinds compared to say britain or the scandanavian nations ?
- who are usually considered the biggest welfare states in the world .
EDIT :
ok , so i have had look today and it looks like america spends 46 % of its budget on welfare programmes .
59 % if you add pensions .
look at this chart here from the us government spending website .
it has 24 % health , 22 % pensions , and 13 % welfare .
is that how to work it out ?
http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_spending
Yes , a lot of money ( read . too much money ) is spent on SS etc.
However , the taxation rates on average are still 10 % higher at least in european nations .
This is why we need a republican government to try and decrease our ridiculous government spending .
Republicans do nothing but spend money , and fight wars --- and encourage wars --- and spend more money trying to put americans in a constant state of fear .
Republicans are a joke
Apparently 44 % of Americas budget is spent on Medicare / Medicaid and Social Security which is a joke considering how naff American welfare is
Suppose you got a letter that stated you must attend a month of military training before you are sent to Iran / Zimbabwe / Syria to protect the civilians from oppression .
It must be on ground to minimise civilian casualties .
Your friends are going to protect these civilians too .
Do you go or do you sacrifice your dignity ?
This is a " humanitarian " mission after all .
Not going would in no way sacrifice your dignity .
What if you have three children to feed ?
How would making the choice not to leave them alone and destitute mean you surrender your dignity .
This is nonsense .
In answer to the more general question you are trying to pose : no , I would n't .
Anybody who does such work deserves all of our respect ( assuming no ulterior motive ) but it is n't for everyone , and that does n't make somebody a bad person .
I would protect my family and friends , I have no interest in personally protecting strangers ...
i 'm not here to save the world , in no way does that decision impact my dignity
In 1951 Libya was the poorest country in the world , before the nato intervention Libyans enjoyed the highest standard of living in Africa .
In Libya , homes are considered a human right .
Newly married couples receive $ 50,000 to buy their own home and electricity is free for all .
Im not making all this up
Gaddafi vowed to house every Libyan before his own parents , he kept his promise and his own father died before he was able to be housed .
Before Gaddaffi , less than 1/5th of Libyans were literate .
Now education is free and high quality .
Literacy rate is now 83 % .
Healthcare is also free .
If libyans can not find the education or healthcare they need in Libya the government unds them to go abroad to access it .
All loans are interest free by law .
If a Libyan buys a car , the government pays 50 % of the price .
The price of fuel is $ . 14 a gallon .
Any Libyan wishing to become a farmer is given free use of land , a home , equipment , livestock and seeds .
On July 1sr 2011 , 1. 7million people assembled in Green Square , Tripoli to show defiance against the Nato bombing of Libya .
This represented around 95 % of the population of Tripoli .
The Libyan central bank is state owned and unlike banks in the west is now owned by the elite or ridden by debt .
Gaddafi didnt have to drive around in Libya with 8inch thick glass or a tank like Obama does ,
search youtube , theres plenty of videos of him beign driven around waving and shaking hands of the dozens of people running after him .
2 years ago western leaders all over the world praised him .
Yes Gaddafi has been accused of some terrible things , but look at the things western leaders do all of the time .
The second he started giving out oil contracts to Russia / Asia he was ousted .
Disgusting .
OK , cool story , but here 's some facts :
1. He started a war in Chad - a crushingly poor nation that was in the middle of a civil war at the time - with the intent of establishing a puppet Jamahiriya that he could control .
Thankfully he failed after Chad , with the assistance of France , expelled his forces .
2. He started this war in Chad by luring immigrants from Pakistan and poor Sahelian nations to Libya with the promise of civilian work , and then press - ganging them into fighting as the Islamic Legion .
Many legionnaires are still a major threat to peace and stability in Central Africa today , specifically in Darfur where they are now known as the Janjaweed .
Perhaps you 've heard of them ?
3. He directly funded terrorism against the United Kingdom in the form of the IRA , which he also trained and equipped , and sponsored other acts of international terrorism such as the Lockerbie bombing .
4. He embezzled billions of dollars of public money to fund a lavish , dictatorial lifestyle for him and his family .
5. He illegally proliferated nuclear weapons , chemical weapons and biological weapons in flagrant violation of international law .
6. Any political dissent within Libya was brutally repressed by the Khamis Brigade , directly lead by Khamis Gaddafi - one of his sons , and composed of foreign mercenaries willing to do anything against the Libyan people for their next payslip .
7. Libyan political refugees were assassinated by the state as a means to oppress the opposition to his rule .
If you have any love lost for this man you are a terrible human being .
I think he did that to keep his people happy so that people would be less likely to oppose him or he started out good genuinely wanting to help his people but became obsessed with power .
So vile .
How can a country like the USA , relatively liberal and tolerant , have such a powerful party of extremists ?
Britain has nothing to match the Republican Party , on social issues , apart from perhaps the BNP - but even they do n't hate on gays as much as the Republican Party does .
In 2011 , how can Americans even think of voting in such a party ?
It 's disgusting .
Shame on the republicans .
It 's an incredibly religious country - and a very evangelical one at that .
As much as I hate their attitude , you need to understand that it 's just the way they 've been brought up to think
That being said , it is still shocking that this type of discrimination still exists ...
The people who get involved in politics to the degree of going to debates are , thankfully , not representative of the majority of people over there .
Does n't stop them being dicks , though
And ? This is surprising ?
It 's known that the USA is n't as progressive as Western Europe with regards to gay rights and attitudes towards gay people .
To be fair , Santorum is probably just a confused idiot .
He said that sex has no place in the military and orientation is irrelevant , which I agree with .
But then he said he 'd bring DADT back , which is disagree with .
But the booing of the soldier was terrible make no mistake .
If a gay soldier is better than , or just as good as a straight soldier , then it makes no difference what their sexuality is .
At the end of the day , if I was serving on the front line with other troops , I 'd want the best troops , not the straightest .
What makes me laugh is that the usual anti - American crowd has jumped on this thread with all the " vile " and " disgusting " comments .
The same crowd that gets into a lather about the evil empire of Israel and the poor Palestinians blahblahblah .
The USA has legalised gay marriage in some states , and federal equality laws . Sure , some people are n't up with that - but that 's freedom for you .
Contrast this with the wonders of the Palestinan Authority , where it is a criminal offence to be gay and punishable by imprisonment .
You hear a lot of criticism of Israel - but if you had to , would you rather live there or one of its closest neighbours ? Bearing in mind Israel 's freedoms , prosperity , etc.
Note : I know some of the countries do n't physically neighbour Israel , but they are extremely close so they count .
Eygpt , probably because they 're comparitively level and calm . ( I said comparatively ) .
For religious , political and social freedom . Israel
Because it 's the most westernised , Israel .
I know a LOT of Lebanese people and let me tell you , they 're the most fun loving persons I have ever met .
Really open - minded and peaceful .
It looks really beautiful too !
Israel because its the least likely country to get bombed and invaded by Israel
Jordan or Israel .
Plus to all the people saying Egypt , really ?
Its future is very uncertain and Christians ( assuming some of you are ) are routinely not treated properly .
I really have no idea why -- unless you were a devout Muslim -- you would choose Saudi Arabia over Israel .
Unless you have no care for any of your freedoms .
And before anyone makes any sarcy comments about Israel , at least a woman can drive there ..
None , when I was in Cyprus the heat was too annoying , so I 'd rather not reside in that region .
Lebanon . Beirut is a relaxed , westernised place and the party capital of the middle east
Cyprus ... what ?
Its only a little swim away i 'd call it a neighbor , lived there for 2 years , lovely , go for a swim in the sea catch some rays on the saturday , then off to build a snowman on Troodos on the sunday , great little island .
I saw the news story about the submariner who went on a killing spree on a nuclear submarine and it worried me quite a bit .
Is it realistic that in the next 30 years there 'll be worldwide dismantlement of all nuclear weapons intended for killing other humans ?
Never hopefully .
Nuclear weapons have kept the worlds superpowers from wiping each other out
The Submarine was just powered by a Nuclear Reactor , it fires non nuclear warheads .
The day they 'll be gotten rid of is the day something more powerful is invented .
We have every reason to hope that does n't happen , tbh .
Why would governments and companies in certain countries sell arms to an offensive country when they attack a country they dislike but then attack that country when it attacks a country they do like
this is double standards !
I am talking about the Iraq before and during the Gulf War .
Iraq attacked Iran then governments were happy to sell weapons to Iraq including UK , France , US , West Germany , Italy , China and Soviet Union .
Some of them were even selling to both sides such as US , Soviet Union and China .
A small minority sold only to Iran these were North Korea and surprizingly Israel according to Israel ( although Iran denies this ) .
Why would all these countries be happy for Iraq to go on the war path and to fund both all sides of the war yet go after Iraq when it starts on Kuwait ( although they left Saddam in power ) .
My thoughts are that governments simply let their private arms companies make a bit of cash off the war like they usually do .
They used their puppet governments of the Shah and Saddam to control the countries to counter Soviet influence in the region .
When the Islamic revolution happened the US lost all their influence over the nation so after Iraq began their attempted invasion they happily cast a blind eye in order to regain influence .
Then when they saw Saddam invading country they already had influence in Kuwait they finally took action although they left him in power as the Soviets were still there and would n't want Iraq to become communist .
Then 12 years later there is no longer a Soviet union but they notice a strengthening Iran that is a potential threat to their ally Israel so when some they get some ' evidence ' of Iraq with nuclear material from a known unreliable source via MI 6 they jump with joy to invade it .
It is a win win for their publicity they either take out evil dictator Saddam or they stop Iraq getting nukes .
Then they build up their bases in Iraq and fund a new government to counter the threat of Iran as they lost all influence upon Iraq when they stopped them in the first gulf war .
These wars are just ways to prevent other nations gaining any sort of power whether it is directly or indirectly as well as make their arms companies some major money on the side .
So if you still think the US and co are the just and honourable governments they claim to be why would they allow companies to fund two sides of a war ?
why would they go to war over an ideology ?
why would they only take action when a puppet state is invaded ?
Well , what are you proposing to replace it with ?
Because governments change every 4 years in most places and every government tends to pursue a different policy .
Blair sold guns to Gaddafi and Cameron helped oust him , you ca n't look at it as if Cameron is bound or responsible for the actions of Blair
A countries actions should n't ( and luckily do n't ) depend on moral standards .
It is naive to think they should .
There are far more important political and economical reasons for military intervention or political sanctions .
I certainly do n't , they 're mostly hypocrites .
If only we could make the leaders look right into the eyes of every civilian they kill , maybe the fighting and wars would stop .
Obviously I know it never will , but I can dream .
There is so much discussion these days about race , muslims , etc that I get the feeling there are underlying problems .
Personally I feel sorry for them ( non whites and Muslims ) as they bear the brunt of these discussions .
Or are we just in denial of racial and ethnic problems in society ?
" learn from history " - yes , and it teaches us " multiculturalism " actually always fails .
I do however believe we could get along together , if we figured out how .
Douchebags like this being given a forum to air their views is fanning a lot of contagious stupidity
well this is the case no matter the denial .
its funny , when muslims plants bombs , the first thing people say is , ' why did they do this ? ' , well , fair enough , because its better to understand motives , the same applies to the growth of nationalism in europe .
many factors are at play , anti white racism , immigrant crime which targets white people disproportionally , mass invasion immigration policy , abuse of immigration and welfare systems .
it is no use just blaming ' racism ' as it misses the issues .
so everyone is just getting along fine ,
regardless of race , religion , nationality and ethnicity etc ?
I do n't think that is true either
I 'm as right - wing as they come , but why are the British keeping hold of islands that are not theirs ?
They are thousands of miles away .
I long for the day that the islands are reunited with Argentina and diplomatic relations between Britain and Argentina can resume .
What are your thoughts ?
When hell freezes over .
When the Falkland Islanders decide they want to be Argentinian .
They are quite fond of being British right now .
Is this another name for the Falklands ?
As I understand it , the inhabitants of these islands feel a strong sense of Britishness , and want to continue to remain British .
The islands belong to the islanders , not argentina , and if the islanders say they want to be argentinian , or independent , then the islands would cease to be british .
Can you not understand the difference between an individual in one country wanting to be a citizen of another ( basically a wannabe migrant ) and a state wishing to retain its territorial status ?
In your American example , that 's the difference between a dude in Azerbaijan saying " I want to be American - why ca n't I ? " and Hawaii saying " We want to remain part of the US " .
That 's true ; the oil in the Falklands is not a major factor .
Although I do believe that if the majority of Islanders wish to be British we should keep the Islands .
When we get Ireland ' back ' .
I mean they in no way want to be part of the UK , but they 're right next to us , so they should be ...
Why does the term ' Las Malvinas ' even exist ?
Why do n't I just call Argentina ' dickhead land ' .
Also , OP , ignorance much ?
They already belong to the UK and the UK grants them local governance .
So technically they already belong to their owners .
They never were united with Argentina
The problem with this logic is there are more than enough people who think differently to cover the costs - and they ( or anyone in fact ) could n't care less what you think .
They will be paying for the defence themselves if with the oil revenue as well so there will be even less reason for you to complain in the future .
I have to write about the IMFs involvement in current affairs for school , i must have been living under a rock for the past few months because I have NO idea at all as to what the IMFs involvment with Greece is , ive tried to google it but all the different information is confusing me , can anyone explain please ?
They are called in when countries fail to run their economy properly .
Of course Eurocrats failed to see what was happening ... what do you expect from hansomly - paid , non - audited people resposible for other - people 's money ?
Like the fall of the Roman Empire , the whole mess is gonna get worse .
In May China 's CPI went up by 5.5 % year - on - year , 5.3 % in cities and 6.0 in rural areas .
Attention that the food prices went up by an astonishing 11.7 % .
This is definitely increasing the pressure on its economic growth .
Everyone has his / her point of view .
That 's only a percentage point higher than the UK , but unlike us they have double digit economic growth so have plenty of room to work with .
I mean , if inflation is 5.5 % but the economy grows 10.5 % , that 's net wealth creation of 5 % is n't it ?
Or is there something I 'm missing ?
even if the rate of economic growth almost doubles the rate of inflation , the effects of this high rate of inflation are still prominent ; especially due to china 's very unequal distribution of wealth .
" 5.3 % in cities and 6.0 in rural areas "
The rural areas accomodate many of the peasants in china and as it faced such high rises in food prices and a 6 % rise in general prices , those peasants are going to find it increasingly hard to purchase their commodities .
I am sure many of us are well aware of Samuel Huntington 's " Clash of Civilizations " theory , that future conflict would be along cultural lines between " West " , " East " and " Confucian " blocks , whatever they are .
What does everyone think ?
Does the theory hold weight or is it just a product of modern day Oriental - ism ?
The OP 's mind is moving in , in my opinion , the right direction .
Conflicts are almost always caused by political and economic issues rather than cultural ones , even if motives for fighting may ostensibly appear to be over religion , for example .
If you have JSTOR access and have n't read Ervand Abrahamian 's article on Huntington , then I recommend it .
Something that caught my eye today .
It seems Australia is proposing a ban on the cultivation and possession of a range of plants that contain certain psychoactive substances .
These are the plants that are already included in Australias ban list :
- all plants in the Cannabis genus
- all plants in the Erythroxylum genus ( Which cocaine is derived from )
- Papaver somniferum and Papaver bracteatum ( opium poppies )
- all fungi that contain psilocin and psilocybin ( magic mushrooms )
These are the plants that would be added to the ban list :
- Savia divinorum
- Kratom
- Khat
- Brugmansia
- Datura ( the former and latter both common garden flowers , but are crap as recreational drugs due to their high toxicity . Idiots who try it once wont try it again , if they survive . )
- Any plant that contains Ephedrine
- Any plant containing Mescaline
- Any plant containing DMT ( this is the one i find most absured as there are litterally 100s if not 1000s of plants and trees that contain this substance , many grow wild in Australia and are commonly used in landscaping .
DMT even occurs naturally in humans and most other mammals , are they going to ban humans and mammals too ! ? )
As a horticulturalist myself , i find the Australian authorities proposals to be highly disturbing .
This is completely pointless legislation , bureaucracy at its finest , that is going to criminalise potentially millions of innocent people who work with these plants or grow them ornamentally in their gardens .
And just how do they expect to be able to enforce a ban on litterally thousands of species of plants ?
Its insanity , you cant legislate nature .
And then of course we come back to the old chesnut ; most of the substances in these proposed plants are less harmful and addictive than legal substances , such as alcohol and tobacco .
Mescaline and DMT actually cause less harm to the body than CAFFEINE .
Anyhoo , rant over .
This article is a few months old , so i dont know if this made it into the law books or if it was thrown out , so if anyone has any information id like to hear about it .
Heres hoping common sense prevails for once .
how do they ban cannabis in australia ?
dosent it grow as a. ... well weed
It 's your responsibility to use drugs sensibly and your choice whether you abuse them or not .
It 's no right of the government or anyone to control what you consume .
I think the government should tackle drug use and damaged lives by providing support for those who need it , not by criminalising them .
Many drug addicts get send to prison and are given Methadone to ' ease ' their addictions to crack , meth or heroin .
Obviously that 's wrong .
= / that 's the harsh reality of it .
ban the substance in the first place .
it will cause damage now to those addicted but better for long term
i do see the value of rehab though
It 's the illegality of drugs that makes the production , distribution and use of those drugs hugely expensive and harmful to everyone .
Most of the outlawed drugs , if taken with a bit of knowledge and awareness , are mostly as harmful , if not much less harmful , than tobacco or alcohol .
What did you think of the first 2012 Republican debate on Thursday ?
It featured Tim Pawlenty , Ron Paul , Herman Cain , Gary Johnson , and Rick Santorum .
It is in the early days , so there were n't that many candidates .
And what did you think of the Saturday Night Live version of the ' undeclared ' candidate 's debate .
It featured impressions of Michele Bachmann , Donald Trump , Mitt Romney , Newt Gingrich , Jimmy McMillan , and of course , Sarah Palin played by the legendary Tina Fey !
I thought it was great . Pure humour .
Edit : Mike Huckabee was n't in either . Hmm ....
I like Ron Paul more and more
Herman Cain I would support any means to protect the country . Not liking the sound of that
The Fox News one seemed to be let down by the fact that so many of the undeclared big names were n't there ( for the obvious reason that they 're undeclared ) .
Ron Paul would be the lead runner of those that took part , but the SNL people are far more likely to be the main contenders .
That said , where was Obama this time in the 2008 race ?
Notwithstanding a few of his religious nutter - esque social views Ron Paul is the only Republican who actually makes sensible points about big government and the only one I have any respect for .
Too bad he 's never going to be President given the state of the Republican party .
I just saw a similar thread on SAudi arabia , so i thought , why not in Pakistan as well ?
I dont need to explain the situation there ...... but shouldnt they have a revolution ?
The press is relatively free so people have a medium they can vent through .
There are too many factions that are fighting amongst each other - if they unite under a common cause then there would be a serious threat of revolution .
Firstly , Gaddafi was not an enemy of ours .
Secondly , Gaddafi is the autocrat of his country , if he wishes to stamp out rebellion , it 's his prerogative .
All states hold the right to defend their own interests .
Humans are cruel , people should get over it , it 's our nature .
Additionally , should n't our own armed forces be used for national defence only ?
Of all of these conflicts over the past 20-30 years or so , which directly affected our interests :
- the Falklands
- the first Gulf War ( liberation of Kuwait )
- Bosnia
- Sierra Leone
- Kosovo
- Second Gulf War ( removal of Saddam )
I would say only The Falklands .
The Falklands the first Gulf War and to an extent the second gulf war .
I see what your saying but if we have a chance to help people fight for democracy and not be brutally crushed then we should do something .
We rarely get the chance to support rebellions as in most cases the rebels are as bad as the government they are fighting .
Libya can be seen as a popular uprising against a Tyrant .
No doubt people complain but they would complain if we did nothing to .
No one wants to see another Rwanda and this event seems to signify a much more proactive Right foreign policy from the UK.
And before people shout oil at me .
Well you are just going to have to wait until after this ends are n't you to see if it was .
Frankly I can not imagine why companies would negotiate oil contracts only to try to convince the government to invade the country so they lose them .
Taking some of the responsibility for enforcing a no fly zone ( i.e. patrolling shooting down any planes which Gadaffi uses to bomb civilians ) would have been acceptable due to the UN resolution and the fact that civilians in Benghazi were sitting ducks .
However , bombing ground troops in order to allow armed rebels to rampage further west is , in my opinion , completely against the spirit of the UN resolution .
I increasingly get the impression that the coalition are not protecting civilians ( i.e. unarmed citizens , not rebels ) but rather are passively supporting the rebellion by decimating Gadaffi 's soldiers who , at the end of the day , are just doing what they are told .
It 's easy to shout oil and the fact that it gets shouted so often means that it 's also brushed off by those supporting military action , without a thorough evaluation .
Oil is not the only reason why the coalition are backing the rebels ( and I 'm going to take the plunge now and say that they are ) , but it is certainly a consideration .
Gadaffi has stated that ( assuming he regains control over his country ) he will only sell oil to the Russians and the Chinese .
The rebels on the other hand have stated that they are willing to upgrade oil production in Benghazi three - fold .
People can argue that we are doing our bit by helping out the Libyans in their time of crisis .
But why have n't we intervened in the numerous conflicts in Africa over the past 20/30 years
I agree that we should be helping out all these innocent people ( im sure if it was the other way around we would want help from more powerful countries )
But why there and not in other places ?
I do think our main reason for helping is oil and resources , which is pretty much as bad as doing nothing as we 're not setting the example of helping people out in a time of crisis , its more of a " we 'll help but only because we might get something in return "
I know this is just how the world works , but there would be alot less trouble in the world if it wasnt .
Anybody who believes the British Empire , once again , intervened in yet another country on ' humanitarian grounds ' to protect ' innocent civilians ' is absolutely ignorant of history and can not use mere logic , or at least does not apply it to ' Queen and Country ' .
Or , they could be the opposite of independent thinkers and accept the propaganda spouted by the establishment .
If the rebels were Communists , the intervention lead by the United States , Britain and France in Libya would not have occurred , nor would the rebel opposition be supported , had they been Communists .
In other words , the intervention in Libya is not about protecting civilians , but instead entirely about protecting interests and siding with a candidate whom the ' coalition ' prefers .
If this was not the case , the United States would be intervening exactly how they are today in Libya , even if the rebels had been the Taliban .
Furthermore , Britain and France have always stated from the very beginning that they were willing to intervene in Libya without the approval of the United Nations .
Yet the justification they keep using for this intervention is to ' enforce humanitarian law authorised by the United Nations ' .
To be blunt while being honest ...
History will show once again , that the real reasons for this Capitalist - lead intervention in Libya was not about ' defending innocent people ' .
And when it does , all those who supported this intervention should be held accountable for their ignorance and the crime of strengthening a system which has consistently proven , through its billions of dead victims , to be the greatest monster this world has ever seen .
ok guys , we 've seen how the egyptians successfully brought mubarak down and at the same time theres also a lot of protesting goin around the middle east countries ; tunisia , bahrain , algeria etc. ....
although it may not seem like it has nothing to do with religion , just politics ... i feel like the world is coming to an end or something cause muslims are finally taking a stance for their rights ....
after this , what next ?
was just wondering could there be an islamic revolution perhaps in the near future where the world is like coming to an end ???
this is probably a really stupid question but just give me some feedback about this matter
The answer is no.
guys .. i know its a bit tedious but im just wondering ..
if you guys can be bother than dont bother reading it then !
God willing , yes , if only to overthrow the corrupt governments in place in these countries .
None of these protests are Islamic in nature .
They tend to be secular leaderless and made u mostly of the young .
What is wrong with Muslims speaking up for their rights ???
explain yourself .
And as far as an Islamic revolution is concerned i would say that it depends on how organized religious or clerical organizations are in a country and how politicized they are .
Any analysis on the issue ca n't be a one size fits all jacket since the nature of the protests vary in all said countries .
It apeas Noth Korea has started enriching uranium at a brand new plant that apparently is very modern .
Seems odd they could build this . Im betting on a lot of Chinese maybe even Russia help .
It would appear they are going to ake more nukes .
Ok so what are your thoughts on this ?
Are they a danger ?
Will this change anything ?
Could we see a much more aggressive north Korea ?
Or will nothing change ?
I very much doubt Russia would be involved in this .
China are sympathisers with the communist regime so possibly links there .
There 's very little anyone can do about it because bombing their nuclear facilities will result in Seoul being obliterated and most of South Korea being destroyed without nukes .
The only hope is if Dear Leader 's son allows change but do n't hold your breath .
Hey guys , Reading the news daily , I ca n't help but notice that occasionally , the western media ( CNN and sometimes BBC ) pictures China as a country who is heartless , has no respect for human rights , dictatorship etc. etc .
However , this past summer , i went to China for holiday , and it was nothing like the western media pictured it to be , the people all seem to enjoy life , no signs of human rights abuses ( i traveled to Tibet to , the people seemed happy ) .
I ca n't help but feel that the western media is portraying only one side of the story ( Tibet ) , when in reality we Brits have also invaded Tibet and the world said nothing .
I see that we are afraid of a communist country rising , and i know they are n't the nicest people , but neither were we when we colonized 1/4 of the world , or when the Americans drove the Indians off their land .
Are we right to be complaining about China when we do n't have a clean record either ?
Do you think that the western media is demonizing China ?
As a westerner , do you think China is a cold , heartless dictatorship ?
I 'm half Chinese and the Western media is definitely demonizing China .
The Chinese government has more support from its people than the British government does .
When the West criticizes China about its lack of democracy of humans rights abuses it 's usually only the West who has a problem with it and not the average Chinese person .
And why are these clowns always complaining about Tibet ?
The fact that they do n't care about Uyghurs just shows what hypocrites and bigots they are .
That 's because whenever a Chinese person does complain they get thrown in prison or shot .
China 's record on human rights is appalling look at the one child policy that is causing major gender imbalance problems as well as being brutally implemented , forced sterliseation and such .
although I do n't criticise it on democracy as democracy is always right or good .
As for the more popular than the British government source ?
The media demonoising china is just what the media does , it demonises everything its how they sell papers with horror stories .
Even if they get nukes iran are still heavily outmanned , outgunned and isolated .
Their nukes wont be as good as american and european nukes .
Their UAV 's wont be as good as isreali and american UAV 's
Their missiles will barley cross their own borders before they are shot down by a multitude of defences the USA has ALREADY been preparing in the middle east for the past god knows how long .
The only thing the extremist muslims can possibly do is blow themselves up in our borders .
And they have failed that more than enough times .
iran is a empty threat .
Iran with nukes however will unify and strengthen the resolve and moral of the muslims
Iran wants to portray itself as the ' hero ' of the muslims against the western infidels by having nukes and defying the USA .
So the more we talk about it , the more coveradge they get and the more muslim extreamists will orgasm at the sound of USA 's threats .
So lets ignore iran , they are like the kid in primary school with the attention seeking problem .
Meh Maybe if the came clean with their nuclear program and would accept help that the rest of the world is offering .
If they are so peaceful why not allow UN inspectors in .
The problem is n't that they could potentially outmatch us in terms of nuclear capability .
The problem is that its monstrous regime will become more stable , and will be able to dictate the rest of the world 's policy towards it .
Plus , one must consider the potential ramifications of thermonuclear weapons falling into the hands of a regime run by the clergy ; a clergy that has repeatedly laid claims to the island nation of Bahrain , supports Nasrallah 's thuggish militia in Lebanon , makes continual references to the apocolypse and the return of the ' twelfth imam ' , and so on .
That 's without going into how it will make a complete mockery of international law and non - proliferation .
Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II dies , Prime Minister Julia Gillard has said just days ahead of a general election .
Welsh - born Ms Gillard said the Queen 's death would be an " appropriate point " for Australia to move away from having a British monarch as head of state .
Australians voted against becoming a republic in a 1999 referendum , but the issue continues to be divisive .
So , who thinks Australia would vote for a republic ?
It 's up to them if they wish to sever the bonds that unite their heritage , history , and present .
I do n't think the issue is that they have a hereditary monarch , but the fact that the hereditary monarch in question is a ' foreign ' one ( yes , I am aware she is Queen of Australia in her own right , but you know what I mean ) .
I think they should keep the monarchy ...
the monarchy exists here for the same reason it does over there .
Heritage , history and present , as the above poster rightly said .
It 's not a drain on their economy and their power and sovereignty is n't being controlled in real political terms .
I do , however , agree with the proposed flag change , if that 's what Australians want .
Hold another referendum !
Are we witnessing a new era of repression .
In the past nations would develop new technology to dominate its rivals , however with recent attempts to prevent Iran from developing Nuclear technology are we seeing powerful nations using economic terrorism ( sanctions ) and war to prevent other nations from developing technology to compete .
For a nation with civilian and military nuclear technology to essentially deny another nation the same right to develop technology it is clear that the old guard of westenr powers are trying to prevent emerging powers from developing the same level of technology .
How can Iran stake its claim to its right ?
Economic terrorism ( sanctions ) are essentially a way to ruin an economy its a modern day version of a seige and an act of war .
The sanctions placed on Iran are designed to appear to target only military groups but with research you will see it massively targets civilian business , infrastructure and even the attempt of Iranian students to study outside of Iran .
This is an all out attempt to cut of Irans blood flow and crush this nation .
What should other nations learn from this ?
Other developing nations would be wise to realise that western powers have a stake in preventing the development of nations they consider inferior particularly Asian , African and South American nations .
This realisation should make them realsie they must band together to defeat this racist threat .
I would suggest an economic block and the sharing of nuclear technology within this block to ensure their sovereignty from both military and economic war .
America has a vested interest in keeping certain nations poor and weak but with solidarity and strength these nations can rise up and defy this evil threat .
Hmm here is a country that generally does n't like me should I let them build a big nuclear weapon they can kill me with ?
* thinks hard *
Iran will get destroyed by the Israelis before it has a chance to get a nuclear weapon , and if Israel is unable to do so then the Israeli race would be ( excuse the pun ) exterminated .
How can you be in favour of this ?
You make it out like hampering a nations development is somthing new !
Since the dawn of civilization countries and provinces have sort do out do each other and gain from others weakness .
You say it is crazy that america forces sanction on Iran , yet it is not in their economic or defence interests to allow this to happen so in fact it is perfectly sane .
If iran were to developed nuclear weapon , they would use them , and they would , theoretically , become the powerhouse in the middle east .
This is against US forgien policy for two reasons , firstly they need to secure the safty of the oil fields in the middle east , and secondaly an anti - western superpower in the middle east will more likely that not attract the backing of China , who already have made it perfeclty clear that they are inforcing their dominance over Africa .
The combination of an Iranian - Chinese block in Asia and Africa would seriously threatern the US and the whole Western world .
Thus , it is just and needed for the US to impose such sanctions on Iran .
If ahmadinejad did say this , does he have any info as to what is gonna go down ?
Do you think the americans will strike other ME countries in the run up to the iran attack or simulataneously strike ?
Could be syria perhaps ?
Just hope we do n't get dragged into this war ; we ca n't even deal with the taliban ...
let the american / israelis deal with it !
There 's nothing about it on the BBC , but yes , a strike is inevitable .
I highly doubt the Americans / Israelis will strike any other Middle Eastern countries , in fact , I can not see it happening whatsoever .
The United Kingdom will do exactly as the United States says because of this idiotic perception that both of our nations share a ' special relationship ' .
The United Kingdom will be dragged into it , you can bet your bottom dollar on that .
Substantial evidence has been presented to prove large quantities of Depleted Uranium ( DU ) has been used in Iraq since the invasion in 2003 .
[ Edit ] Ok since alot of people think the ' Tehran Times ' is untrustworthy I will give another source which gives the same information about Liam Fox 's statement .
I ca n't bring myself to understand this in any way .
I remember seeing some pictures of deformities a little while back and could n't even believe it was humanly possible .
They disturbed for a few days after and that 's from someone who is n't easily upset .
Back then I always believed that the leaders of our militaries would never allow this .
They would never allow generations of Iraqi 's to suffer from mutations and deformities like these .
I passed it off as propaganda at the time but now the evidence seems substantial and clear that this is exactly what happened .
What is the most upsetting is that our taxes funded this .
Our taxes causes girls to be born with two heads like something straight out of a horror film .
How can this ever be rectified ?
How can you explain to the children why they are born with paralysed limbs or are born with their eyes formed inside out ?
How can you rectify a system which has done to Iraq what it 's done over the decades .
From supporting tyrants , to watching on and doing nothing , to several large scale wars , to crippling sanctions .
What harm were they afraid of from these ordinary , poor Iraqis .
You ca n't rectify .
That 's * * * * * * * disgusting and I hope the perpertrators are made to suffer what generations of Iraqi 's already have and will ever endure .
Remember those who champion themselves on human rights are actually the biggest terrorists in the world .
certain places like fallujah , tikrit , mosul atc , baathi scum strongholds deserve it for what they did to Iraq and the Iraqi people under saddam 's ( May God curse him ) regime .
That 's * * * * * * * * for a start the US would not a shell a town with DU , it 's high density means it is used for penetrator core for armour piercing sabot rounds , to be used against tanks .
It 's a kinetic energy round and would serve no purpose other than in a pitched tank battle , of which there were n't that many in GW 2 .
And that 's the Independent article , I do n't even need to bother trying to discredit something from the ' Tehran Times ' .
Well that 's war is n't it ?
Never liked it but when war happens you have to expect any atrocities .
They want to sue the UK and US ?
It is a * * * * * * * war we would be stupid to give them money because they will only use it for weaponry to fight against our armed forces and they will probably plant some DU in our country or even nuke us innocent civillians for payback .
Sure we all want war to be just and we all think nothing like this should happen , but you 'd be naive to think this is possible and this is how a war should be conducted .
It 's a * * * * * * * war .
Do n't tell me Muslim countries like Iran and pre - war Iraq would n't invoke such methods if they could .
Apologies for being so inevitably stupid but ... J Am I wrong in thinking superpowers are judged by their worth , their GDP ?
If so , how can China overtake the US even as it grows in this area ?
It is still way off the US GDP .
I know the US have a lot of debt , and a great deal of it is owed to China
Also , are n't Japan ahead of China in terms of GDP ?
when you have 1 billion + people , its almost impossible not to become a super power ... even if your army are fighting with swords and bows .... cos it simply is n't possible to win against the sheer amount of numbers
True , thanks for that .
But it 's not like their population swelled overnight , or is it ?
I 'm just trying to find out more about the subject really ..
IMO : growing military strength , economic potential and influence in international affairs make a superpower .
its their industry , cheap labour , huge workforce , investment in technology and hard working nature .
China is investing in the future , we here in Britain really are not ...
China is going for it headlong and because of this are developing more and more and discovering new things .
China also has less strict laws on what not to do ... i.e they will test and fund things that we have regulations against .
They have huge industry which they dont care much in the way of climate problems .
They have a massive population ready for any dirty job .
Finally , they are a hard working people with dedication and less slobby
Do we really want another superpower ?
Compared to the others , China look like a bunch of savages : disgusting human and animal rights records and a lack of freedom .
The GDP is rapidly rising each year .
LOL - Russia 's economy is less than half the size of France and Germany 's and almost half as small as the UK 's .
Coupled with the fact that the country has just been through a huge reccesion that has wiped off more than 10 % of its GDP , and that it is falling to pieces through political instability , I think im right to say its a joke - not to mention the fact that its entire economy is based around exporting natural resources that will soon run out .
It also worth mentioning that as soon as conventional oil reserves run out , the US and Canada will have by far the biggest reserves in the world in the form of Oil Shale etc.
Did you just refer to information from Wikipedia in your argument ?
And some are sort of mutually intelligble .
They all share the same writing language though which I reckon distinguishes from most other languages .
Worthy enough of calling each sub - language a dialect I 'd say .
China already is a super power ; US monetary policy is practically dictated by China .
If they wanted to crap all over the $ they could do it on a whim - no other country on the planet has the ability to do so , let alone devalued their currency to such an extent it makes their exports look ridiculously cheap .
China in the global market .
It is a superpower without question .
However to be a super - power you do n't strictly have to be a developed economy .
China is decades from being as developed as the US , regardless of the amount of money they have - Chinas greatest compromise is time .
Major cities are much closer to their Western counterparts , however it is beyond where the issue lie in Chinas push as a credible economic entity .
What ... so because i referred to wikipedia somehow my argument is null and void ?
seriously get a clue .
I got a few Chinese people telling me that China will be #1 in the future .
A few years back , Newsweek magazine published articles about China 's becoming the next big thing .
Hard to tell but anything is possible .
I bet Soviet Union had no idea they 'd be perished in the late 80s - early 90s .
Like some people said this in thread , US wo n't allow it .
US wants to be the only example that represents democracy ( Iraq being replaced with democratic system , etc ) .
Because China is a communist country , it would be harder for them to influence other countries politically like how Great Britian influenced its idea to different regions of the world ( US in language , Hong Kong in legal structure and language , etc ) .
30-40 years is a very long time , I 'm not denying that China has potential and could potentially become the most powerful country in the world .
Notice the world could in bold , some people would argue that if it continues this growth it would become the world 's most powerful country , both economically and militarily even I can see that , but the US will inevitably interfere , because it simply does n't want competition , it wants to remain being the biggest , baddest dude on the block , and with China arriving on the world stage ( i.e the new kid on the block ) there 'll inevitably and undoubtably be confrontations .
I think China will become the world 's second largest economy - perhaps even the largest , I think China will become very strong militarily - perhaps not as strong as the US as it is light years behind , but still strong , perhaps even stronger than all of Europe combined without the use of nukes .
Do I think China will become a US type superpower ?
Meaning that its economy and military are both 10 times stronger than everyone elses - no I do n't , as I 've pointed out in my previous post , there 'll China will inevitably want to become the regional power of Asia , it 'll want to do some land - grabbing of its own ( Taiwan for example ) which will lead to its demise .
Well I think Iran 's only real crime has been defying US energy interests in the region .
We saw what happened last time Iran defied the US in 1953 under Mossadegh , and the result was a CIA coup to put in someone who would happily bleed their country dry of their resources .
The US have only themslefes to blame for the move to the theocratical tyranny we see now , and most people would agree Iran pose no global threat , but western propaganda representing Iran as some nuclear threat has n't been based on IAEA reports or reason , but as the crescent of the ' axis of evil ' , that is those who dare to step out of line .
All roads are pointing towards an attack of some sort .
Whether this is jumping on the back of a popular revolution , or air strikes , who knows , but one is for sure ; an attack would have serious implications , and not just the further destablisation of the region .
I do n't think either the US or the Soviet Union tick the boxes for me .
Neither gained significant land , neither won any significant wars ( indeed , the most famous war America was involved in post WWII was Vietnam , which they flunked ) - hardly characteristics of a traditional superpower .
Superpowers tend to make huge strides in bettering the lives of human civilisation ( the Romans did it by furthering democracy , the British Empire did it with the industrial revolution ) .
The US and SU certainly did n't make any groundbreaking revolutions .
These two countries are best known for stockpiling weapons and racing to the moon - not characteristics of being a superpower .
They had the potential military might to rival classic superpowers , but times have changed so much that it was just never going to happen .
My professor raised this point this morning in class :
" Hundreds and thousands of years ago , my family lived in Norway , in a consequent town where there were families like mine , making a little clan .
We were then chased from Norway , because we were invaded by Norwegians saying that we were strangers , while it had been our land for centuries and centuries , and we could n't be considered as strangers .
Do you ( asking the class ) think that nowadays , I could go back to Norway , and chase the people living there , with the only argument that my family lived there for hundreds of year ?
Bearing this in mind , do you think that Israelians 's motif for going back to their land is sufficient ? "
what do you think of it ?
Is he racist , or is he realistic ?
To be honest if Norway was the center of his religious beliefs and if he had been persecuted all the years after his family got kicked out he would have a different view .
More importantly he is Christian - and he is ruled by Christian governments .
Plus if you look at it from his point of view .
Conquest determines land holding .
His family was in Norway , they got conquered and so ceased to own the land .
Well the Arabs that used to live in Israel got ' conquered ' per se - although a much more benign version of conquest - and so no matter what the original motives for the conquest were , they lost the right to that land .
He is neither racist nor realistic - just wrong .
Well , are they ?
I 'm using extremists lightly , I 'm just using the word as something to categorize them .
As in groups like BNP , Nazis and extremist Muslims or any partly aggressive religion , could they all be counted as bad as each other ?
They can all inspire hate , change stories and have radical / controversial views .
So could they be deemed on the same level ?
Nazis exterminated Jews ...
Extremist Muslism would liek to convert everyoen else ...
and BNP just wants to deport foreigners elsewhere ...
So no not really .
Hate ( although I believe broadly is a bad thing ) is something I can live with ...
Change stories ?
If you mean lie , then yes that is bad
Radical / controvesial are n't bad because they 're radical , they 're bad because of the belief itself .
Why ? Why do the public / media favour Islamic countries over Jewish ones ?
What have the Jews ever done compared to Muslims ?
I mean come on ... this seriously baffles me .
The BBC are biased against America , and therefore Israel .
It 's not really about muslims vs. jews .
This is not true at all .
During the recent attack on Gaza by Israel the BBC were the only channel to not broadcast an appeal for the innocent Muslims of Gaza . Even though all other channels did .
They seem to do pretty much the opposite of what you are saying .
Discuss
only way you have peace is by having a larger stick than the enemy ,
i prefer the U.S to have all the power to say a unstable country like iran .
ROCK ON U.S.A FREE ISRAEL !
no point in discussing this .
I would say ' no ' but they have nuclear weapons and no - one is going to take them away from them .
Disclaimer : I am really not an expert on American politics .
So , as well as the presidential election yesterday , American voters could also vote on a lot of state - specific propositions , one of which was California 's proposition 8 .
Gay marriage has been legal in California since May , but this proposition was in favour of eliminating the rights of gay couples to marry .
It passed .
I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this ..
I think its terrible .
They should n't be allowed to do an about turn like that for no apparent reason , especially given the fact that it only recently became allowed .
They could have at least given it a chance first .
It 's just even more of a shame that , at a time when America appears to be turning a new leaf , there 's still so many people with this frame of mind .
It just really bugs me that it got turned round so soon as well ..
Gay couples should be allowed the happiness that marriage may bring , just like straight couples .
They should have just kept it legal and let those who disagree have a grumble and grind their teeth over it all - it 's not like they 're suffering .
This suprised me to be honest , California has always been known as one of the more progressive states in the union .
The law will probably jump back and forth in the coming years .
California has a huge Roman Catholic population which obviously rejects it , not helped by the large influx of migrant S - American Catholics into the state .
Okay yes , true , they were allowed .
Which did mean people had the right to do them .
But I think the issue of the right to marry is different because people worked to get the right and to change the law for it to be allowed .
It was n't just a right because no one had told them they could n't do it , like your examples .
I think the issue here is not whether marriage is a right , but whether everyone should be considered equal .
Either everyone has the right to marry , or no one does .
Just as nobody has the ' right ' to murder ( which quite frankly I find to be a weak argument due to reasons already mentioned ) , either nobody should have the right to marry , or everybody should .
That 's all there is to it .
I would argue that any law that I judge to be unjust is inherently illegitimate and thus I have no moral obligation to follow it or consider it to be a moral principle , nor would I use it to guide my decision making in any more than potentially in a practical sense .
I certainly could not and will not respect the rule of law when it imposes restrictions on two consenting adults expressing their love , and quite frankly I think that such unjust laws undermine the whole system .
You said you had n't considered prisoners not having the vote , and hypothesised that a good reason might be because they should have their rights removed for committing a crime .
And the incest argument is entirely related . If two people are happy together , why ca n't they get married ?
You want one rule for all , stand by what you say , instead of dodging the uncomfortable reality that even you 're not happy with everybody having the same rights .
It forced schools to teach same - sex marriage as a morally EQUAL alternative , Cal like the rest of America is full of religious people and they do not see this as right .
It will only take away the right for same - sex couples to call it marriage , everything else is still there .
Well , you 're sort of right ; we 're all being treated as second class citizens , but you sort of missed the point .
Rights have been taken away in both instances .
The moral outrage ( here , anyway ) associated with one has not been associated with the other simply because one is acceptable and one is n't ; so it 's not the fact that a right has been taken away is wrong , its that you think X should have a right and that right has been taken away so you 're annoyed .
Incidentally ; if you 're white , female , black , communist , jewish , whatever ; you can still not get married if you 're gay .
If marriage is defined as a man and a woman then banning gay marriage is perfectly legitimate .
My point still stands : if you need a certificate from the state to live your life in happiness then you are a. ) a pathetic individual and b. ) a serf .
So much for the change in America
When are people going to realise that sexual orientation , skin colour and ethnicity has no bearing on what is inside the person and their personality .
As long as you a good person , regardless of anything else then that is all that matters .
Shame on California - It shows what the real attitudes on homosexuality are .
People pretend to be fine with it - but their is ignorance deep inside .
What a sad day for " new " America . It seems while racism is rightly widely condemned there is still a lot of Homophobia around .
The sad thing is not that many seem to care
Personally , I think they should have left it ( who cares about homosexuals getting married ? ) but it 's quite common in the US for things that become law by virtue of court decisions to later be subject to public vote .
This was one such case .
Gay marriage was never legislated for in California .
This proposition - approved by the public - trumps a court decision .
I was reading an article about how we need more black sold models for young black people to aspire to .
Because apparently , all young blacks in Britain need an extra reminder not to commit crimes and be involved in gangs .
This highlights a severely racist phenomenon that is considered completely acceptable .
That all these initiatives are exclusively targeting young black British people ( in attempt to curb the apparent swarms of exclusively black teenagers begging to be part of a gang ) while completely ignoring any other skin colour .
Now obviously not every black male wants to go committing crimes all day , and the evidence suggests that blacks like committing crimes just as little as other skin colours do .
So why the disproportionate representation in the media and in crime prevention strategies ?
Why does nobody care about crime in the east European , the Asian or ( god forbid ) the white community ?
Why is nobody saying how great a role model plan B is for all the young white kids growing up in council estates .
You can go anywhere in Britain and see that gang culture and criminals exist everywhere , in every ethnic group .
Logic would dictate that a white oriented initiative would make the most sense for demographic reasons .
Or how about something which does not base its case on skin colour and ethnic origin ?
Do people really think that a poor white teenager does n't need support , encouragement or aspiration ?
I completely agree with everything you 've said .
I also think it 's this ridiculous idea that crime in certain ethnic groups needs to be dealt with more urgently that causes more problems .
If the ethnicity and colour of those committing crimes was n't mentioned , it would be much less big a deal . Why this country feel the need to consistently talk about the colour of people is beyond me .
It 's like when we beg for Asian / black police officers .
If they do n't want to do it , they wo n't .
We should be judged on our merits , not our skin colour .
I believe it 's things like this that make white people believe the country are going against them .
If the government did n't deal with things only to do with race , then I , perhaps naively and idealistically , believe that it would become less of a big deal .
In London , blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crimes .
Hence , why they 're targeted .
Most gangs in London are full of blacks .
Black role models give black people hope .
It 's not about whether it should or why does it , it just does because black community are a semi - community .
Totally agree .
Poor white people ( pre 20th century , just poor people ) have been discriminated against for hundreds of years in Britain .
Immigration happens and we 're suddenly part of the oppressing class ?
Growing up poor and white in a mostly non white school was horrible .
Having to learn about the evilness of white people repeatedly really does n't give white kids the impression that they have a place in our multicultural society .
The reason specific ethnic groups are targeted for trying to reduce crime is because , for whatever reason , crime overall is often higher statistically in these groups .
This is not because their race or culture is wrong or bad in any way , it 's simply a fact that certain groups have higher rates of crime .
Whether it 's the result of poverty or cultural differences and stresses in Britain that are leaving them vulnerable to getting lured into crime , pretending that a group that has more prevalence for crime has n't is just foolish .
I do n't know the statistics , but if black youths are the target of an anti - crime and role - model drive , then it 's probably because they have a higher crime rate than other groups , and because the government wants to make sure that whatever factor it is ( because we know it 's not their race itself ) is addressed so they can have a better future .
And there are schemes targeting white populations , but when there is an imbalance between ethnic groups , it surely has to be a priority to address what is causing this imbalance - if for nothing else then for the sake of equality !
There 's a lot of talk recently about how diversity is necessary , but how far do we go ?
And how do we judge what is a good and strong / positive multiracial country ?
When you look at other western countries like Canada , America , Australia , the vast majority of its immigrants are not white these days and are probably heading for a more diverse future , so much so to the point that these nations will have very different demographic look to them in 50 years time .
They will have great bragging rights you could say when it comes to multiracialism and diversity than Britain or most european countries will maybe not have .
You often here quotes like " Hollywood is too white " " the tories are too white " but what defines what is " too white " ?
So I 'm wondering if people could put Britain in the same context ?
Like I say people brand multiracialism as a good thing , very few want to go back to a 100 % white society but how multiracial do we need to go to satisfy the vast majority of people , particularly liberals ?
I personally think it 's completely necessary but I know many of my opponents will disagree .
Are we still not multiracial enough compared to some of our western rivals ??
What do you think ??
Mate you are all confused .
When people say " the tories are too white " or " hollywood is too white "
what they MEAN is " The amount of white people in the tories are disproportionately represented compared to the british population " .
I.e. 14 % of the british population is non - white , but 14 % of the tories are not correspondingly non - white .
There is a bias in representation .
This is bad because it means certain races are being excluded .
This is COMPLETELY different to asking whether an entire nations population should be a certain skin colour - skin colour should be irrelevant .
It 's absolutely sickening you would want to diminish a race 's presence just for the sake of it .
The question is pretty , well , questionable
I do n't know of many people who want diversity FOR DIVERSITY 'S SAKE .
The issue with places like " white " hollywood is the glass ceiling that keeps minorities AND women out , as there is the feeling ( whether true or not ! ) that there is not a level and fair playing field .
Funny how people come up with imaginary arguments from the " other side " , as I 've never HEARD any of these " liberals " you refer to .
I think , as usual , you 're framing an argument in a way that will make your so called opinion look bad
If a memeber of your family was going an illegal activty would you conact the police about their actions ?
Obviously that depends on the activity .
I 'm not going to report my mate for driving at 80 on the motorway but if I suspected he was a serial killer I might be inclined to tell somebody
I do n't know if contacting the police would be the rationale approach .
I think I would personally confront that family memeber .
If i am unsuccessful i 'd get other family members to help and ultimately if they still refuse to listen -- i 'd leave them to their own accord and let them do what they belive is right or wrong .
Because at the end of the day , my conscious would be clear [ in the sense that i did try and help them ] .
Telling the police would not be wise , as you 'd be creating enemies .
It 'd depend what they were doing .
If I did n't think they were harming anyone ( smoking dope , illegally downloading music etc ) then I would n't report them ; if they were hurting other people ( violent crime , theft from individuals etc ) then I definitely would .
Same goes for anyone I was aware of committing a crime , tbh .
I would n't go ' ooh , you 've murdered ten people with an axe , but you 're my mum so I wo n't tell anyone '
The main arguments i hear about this issue is that this country is ' full ' or that there 's enough unemployment as it is .
What exactly makes people feel that British people deserve to remain in this country more than anyone else who just happens to have been born into poverty or war ?
Surely if we 're all equal then no matter where one 's born , they have equal rights to live in the UK as someone born here .
I 'm not against immigration but i think it should be more regulated .
Why ? Because immigration has already caused a lot of " social issues " and until we solve those problems I do n't think its good to just let everyone in .
How should it work : education of english , their intentions , and to what they will contribute and most importantly their ideologies and beliefs .
To those whom the welfare state is the biggest concern I think the problem arises from the fact that there are already too many english people sponging off the state and if we add anymore people be it immigrants or " britons " our state of government would collapse and then our economy .
Because I wish to protect diversity .
If immigration levels are too high , the indigenous populations ' gene pool will eventually become so diluted to essentially be extinct .
The cultural and genetic distinctions that make the world a diverse , varied and interesting place will be lost , forever .
So that means that in contrast to the general population they are actually slightly under represented therefore the NHS does not rely on immigrants as much as leftie TSR users claim they do .
well certainly in london they are here .
but to be honest if you live in a village like manchester , anywhere in the south west of england , or anywhere as a matter of fact in the rest of the UK , all you will find are whites , but in london you will find ethnic people
besides this is from 2005 , I 'm pretty sure that the figures would be different now .
correct me if I 'm wrong .
The data is nearly 7 years old .
Your point that this shows that there are n't as many immigrants in the NHS as people think is surely not proven by that data - immigrants can be white e.g. immigrants from Italy or Poland would be counted under the white statistic .
All i see on TheStudentRoom these days is agitated non - muslims interrogating muslims , criticising their religion ( as any sane person would ) , muslims signing up to the student room JUST to post some anti - israel propaganda to persuade people about how evil israel is or how islam is the religion of peace
it seems that the blood libel rumour of medeival times that Jews kill christian babies to use their blood for wine is today in the form of zionists / jews / israelis killing palestinian babies just because theyre pure evil , and i think the islamic propaganda machine is succeeding in convincing people ?
anything which takes sides against muslims get a million negs - its obvious muslims are in a huge presence on TSR .
with a quarter of ALL primary school children from ethnic minorities ( mainly islamic ) is the race - relations and religious demography of TheStudentRoom a sign of things to come on a National scale in Britain ?
From TSR to a National Scale is a pretty big jump do n't you think .
Also this is a forum where topics are going to be discussed and these are categorised e.g. religion .
So you have a choice in viewing these threads and not being part of this so called propaganda .
Also in my opinion there are more Atheists than Muslims on TSR .
And what has Jews , zionists and Palestine got to do with Islam ?
Finally " a quarter of all primary school children are Muslim " .
i 've been threatened by countless of them on here .
generally they need positive feedback all the time , eithewise they get really agressive .
most of them are racist in my opinion .
Agreed , if people want to be muslim - then fine .
But when it becomes their life objective to annoy the life out people with their " READ THE QUARAN - OR DIE ! ! ! " threads , it becomes a bit annoying - _ -
Over the past 1-2 years I 've had quite a few discussions with people about current affairs ( namely the issue of terrorism and the related issues of immigration , global politics etc ) and quite often heard a common belief that a british civil war will erupt when ethnic minorities increase in numbers and become more estabished .
This beleif is common amonst certain white british nationalists etc. ..
I do n't believe this will ever happen for various reasons ....
Do any of you beleive that a british / english civil war will take place ( on the basis of race / identity ) ?
If so , what do you predict / envisage ?
I believe it will happen ( something similar to what India has now to an Israel - Palestine type thing ) .
What a ridiculous comparison .
How is it any different ?
The only difference is Palestine are still suffering injustice .
As the numbers of minority groups who do n't respect secular law increase they will demand greater autonomy , and mini - vassal states will appear but still remain part of the UK ( like Palestine ) and things will get pretty tense .
So you reckon that first a large imperial power will rule the UK ( like the Ottomans ruled Palestine ) .
This imperial power will be defeated and then power will pass to another power ( like Palestine became a British mandate ) .
So you think that an entire group of people are going to move to the UK after a genocide , and then a state will be established , voted for and partitioned by the United Nations ?
You then think that neighbouring countries will then invade this new state , that the native British people will be forced to flee to like Cornwall ( Gaza ) and Yorkshire , Lincolnshire , Norfolk , Suffolk , Essex and a part of East London ( West Bank ) .
That these British people will form militant groups , that want to return to the former England .
That this new state will be supported by the USA who will provide it with diplomatic protection and weaponry ?
As I said , absolutely mental to transplant Israel / Palestine to the UK.
not sure how britain can call itself a civilised country when a woman is raped every 10 minutes .
for some people , civilisation seems to rest on how rapists are treated when in custody and not how many rapists actually exist .
i am disgusted by modern britain .
something needs to be done obviously the easiest way to stop rape is to deal with rapists a lot tougher and send out a clear message that it is not acceptable .
at the moment they are given on average 7 years in jail .
its a disgrace .
no other country in the history of the world has been so permissive towards criminals .
britain : weak on crime , tough on the victims of crime .
On a serious note rapists should have longer sentences , I would be happy for them to spend their whole lives in prison if it 's beyond practically any doubt they raped someone
I do n't see how tougher prison sentences will prevent rapes from occurring .
The appellation of ' rapist ' is stigmatising enough ; the scum who rape people clearly do n't care about the consequences .
The sentences rapists and paedophiles ae given are jokes .
Wow , people are so reactionary .
There are so many different types of rape , and situations , a single life sentance makes no sense .
It is a crime of massive degrees of difference , I think the mark of a good legal system is that it can deal with every individual crime , rather than simply handing out the same punishment ragrdless of the circumstance .
That said , we could be tougher on all criminals , not just rapists .
And , to put things into perspective , how often do women have consensual sex ?
What 's that ?
You do n't know ( ! )
Oh well nvm then ...
Bring back capital punishment .
Sorry to have to point out the bleeding obvious to the majority of you , but it seems like a minority of users actually have to be told this : do not make troll posts or " jokes " about rape , it is n't funny .
For rape ?
Are you for real ?
Not just rapists , overall perhaps ?
I 'm honestly shocked by that number , I would have thought it would be more than that .
Although that is just the number of reported rapes , which probably does n't even account for half .
What do you mean by that ?
Do you think it 's not one of the most serious crimes ?
I keep frequently seeing threads made hating on Islam , which is somewhat hypocritical and disturbing I believe in many cases .
I am an Atheist ; therefore I am not trying to defend Islam out of being ' Islamic ' before I am accused of that .
I am also considered by British nationalists to be 100 % British ( Although I reject the idea that it makes a real difference ) , so I am not showing sympathy for Islam out of experiencing similar hostility or racism .
However , I do believe that Islam and Christianity , along with other major religions , all play very similar and negative roles in the world .
Therefore , I do not believe we should be cherry - picking Islam as some specific evil , but rather opposing all religions for the extremely negative roles they play in the world .
The usual argument held against Islam is that it is responsible for terrorism .
This may be correct , but the fact of the matter is ; whether somebody is using Islam to commit terrible acts , regardless of the wrongdoing , all major religion play a large role in shaping societies , and ultimately , fulfil playing a very similar negative role .
And when using the idea that Islam ' inspires terrorism ' , if we were honestly that bothered about such wrong - doing in the world , then we would surely be more concerned with ending the much more severe crisis 's and wrong - doing 's such as starvation and war .
Both of these ills are far more widespread and important than the threat of terrorism , as of which we are more liking to die by our own hands rather than by the hand of an ' Islamic terrorist ' .
It is almost unbelievable how the idea that a Christian should have any sympathy or support when they proclaim a dislike for Islam , when the religion they subscribe to right now in Britain , is playing a much more negative role .
We should oppose religion simply on the basis that all religion plays a negative role .
But we should not bully specific religions because of certain conditions and influences of the societies we presently live in .
This is of course , an argument only for those who aspire to reason , rationality and evidence in mind .
I have no expectation that I will be receive any support for my remarks by Christians or other adherents of major religions .
I am an atheist and I think Islam is the most inherently evil religion out of all the other ones .
I would choose to live in a christian society over a Muslim one any day .
As an atheist I can differentiate between Islam and Christianity , in that Christianity is progressive , whilst Islam is not .
Well to be honest it 's a two headed coin .
I completely agree sometimes , there is a horrendously bad labeling of Islam unnecessarily .
But sometimes it does no come under as much criticism ( for small cases , not the religions as a whole ) as other religions because people just get labelled racist .
I know everybody is gonna neg me as racist but someone has to say it .
Similarly to how not all claims are created equal , and individual claims require differing levels of evidence , neither are all religions created equal and it is rational to dislike a certain religion over another if one can be shown to be more detrimental to another .
So it is irrelevant that you believe all religion plays a negative role , even though I agree with you , because our priorities should be focused on those which are the most detrimental .
Would you honestly have us use the same resources in combating the negative effects of Islam and combating the negative effects of Jainism ?
I would also like you to back up your assertion that Christianity , which in this country is in a weak and almost laughable form , is playing a more negative role in Britain 's society than Islam is right now .
Also , reading your posts you appear to be a highly arrogant , self - righteous , and cocky person .
Your last sentence is almost cringe worthy in its self - importance .
You 're 21 .
Time to get some humility and eat some humble pie , because I guarantee you 're going to be wrong on countless things throughout your life .
If you compare a traditionally Christian / Buddhist / whatever country to a traditionally Islamic country in terms of stability , equality , safety and crime , quality of life etc , there 's a good chance the non - Islamic one is going to come out on top ( there would likely be exceptions , but as a general rule . )
That is one reason why people perceive it to be worse for society .
And I do n't say this out of hate .
I 'm aware that most individual Muslims are friendly and civilised fellows .
We live in an age where celebrities are gods and fame is sought after above all else .
People go crazy when seeing celebrities , faint when they touch them and track their each and every movements via magazines , hell there 's a subforum dedicated to them on this site !
Why do we feel the need to elevate people to celebrity status and worship them ? I really do n't understand how this culture emerged and why .
Must have something to do with providing people with gods to worship and adore in an age in which gods have been killed . By doing so , I guess , many people are saved from nihilism as a result of the loss of values from the death of God . Thus , superstars and rockstars are put on a pedastal for people to look up to and aspire to be like . If we were living in ancient Rome , for example , the superstars and rockstars would be the heroic gladiators , but the best gladiators were often thought of as gods in their own right . They were supposedly treated like gods . Ceasar himself was worshipped as a god by the people . The gods of yestreday are the stars of today . When charles Atlas became famous they were saying he was a god . Great individuals are sometimes regarded as more than human by their fans . Fred Astair , Al Jolson , Charlie Chaplin , James Dean , Marlon Brando , Elvis , Sinatra , Bruce Lee , Bowie , Morrissey , boy bands like Take That , Lady Gaga and the like .
i think its disgusting that the death of a drink and drug adict got 15 seperate articles on the bbc news website , and there wasnt even a mention of the british soldier killed in the same week . people need to get priorities in order
I ca n't recall hearing of this much before the riots of late , so I wonder whether it will become a regular crime from now on .
It does n't have to occur alongside a riot , but carefully planned and limited to a close circle , it could be a very lucractive crime .
If a circle of 10-15 target a high - end retailer during a perfectly normal shopping day , perhaps at a strategic location and time , I do n't really see what could stop them from looting a shop with lots of valuable merchandise within proximity of the entrance e.g. luxury clothes shop .
if we made that number 100/200 it would be nearly impossible to stop them .
Are you trying to set something up or what ?
That 's different though , the riots were promoted like a chain letter , were n't they , rather than a plot between a few people who all actually knew each other , and therefore could be rounded up fairly easily .
And surely it 's just " looting " because it was still associated with general civil unrest .
But people will see the footage of them carrying off luxury goods for nothing and even posing alongside plasmas .
They 'll get ideas .
Apparently it was in a multicultural office . My arse it was .
Even our own English people arent even allowed to do anything because it will offend these immigrants ...
As richard dawkins says , " So what if youre offended ?
Im offended by backwards baseball caps and chewing gum , doesnt mean im going to abolish it "
Okay , i meant to say banned , not arrested .
Id like to make this clear , its not the muslims were having a go at , but the officials .
They recieved complaints ( could be muslims , we dont know ) , and the officials said breastfeeding is offfensive to muslims .
Why did the officials ssay that ?
I think its because this country is afraid of muslims - suicide bombers , poppy burners , stoning people to death .... you know the story .
These officials are saying its offensive because they want to go on the muslims good side and not make any enemies .
Islam is a bad religion .
In fact all religions are bad imo .
I think that 's a bit much .
It 's not up to Muslims if she breastfeeds her child her not .
Telling her to feed her baby in a toilet is also ridiculous .
Muslims are n't offended by breastfeeding , it is just the labour councillor of the multicultural office saying ' it will offend them '
People like this just end up creating arguments between 2 different religions / communities for no reason what so ever
You know what the problem is with this country ?
Our schools dont teach critical thinking .
How much of a * * * * do you have to be to design a curriculum without critical thinking on it ?
If you can ban something somebody else does based on your faith , everybody else can ban things you do based on their faith .
If you want everybody else to use reasoning with you , you have to use reasoning with them .
How many of you support capital punishment ?
This is what I think -
ARGUMENTS FOR :
- Those who murder deserve to have the same done to them
- Can be a deterrent
- Justice for the victim 's family
- Cheaper than prisons
ARGUMENTS AGAINST :
- The person killed could be innocent
- It 's inhumane and barbaric , the criminal may be able to be reformed
- It makes us just as bad as them
Ultimately , I really do n't know how I stand on this issue . Up until recently I was very much in favour of it . I 'd say that maybe it should be used in extreme circumstances but it 'd be difficult to know when not to execute someone .
Any comments ?
To be honest I 'm for it if it 's cheaper . Other than that , meh . I think being in isolation for years at a time would be worse than a quick death , although I 'm not sure .
But then , I 'm not sure if the Death Sentance would be cheaper , as you 'd have to have a mass of appeals and such like before hand .
I would n't support it for first time offenses , but when a criminal is given a second chance and reoffends , I 'm all for it ... I mean , if the evidence is 100 % conclusive that is , which is the case most of the time now with modern technology etc
I was on a tour in Ireland last week when the operator on the bus asked where everyone was from .
As it happened I was the only British person on the bus , and when asked I said that I was from ' England ' .
The guide then said , ' no you 're not , you 're from the United Kingdom ' and started making a big deal out of it and I got quite embarassed .
I was actually really angry at that though because I identify far more as English than I do as British .
When we were in the pub later on , two Argentinians also commented , saying that they did n't think it was right for him to say that , as you would n't expect a Scottish person to say that they were from the UK.
Is it only the English who are n't allowed this kind of pride in where they live ?
Personally I find it nonsensical to be proud of something you have n't chosen or done , but it 's up to you if you want to be proud where you come from .
I could n't care less really what my nationality was , it 's just letters on a passport ,
I still wonder what my identity is , a human being , a Brit , a European ?
No , I prefer to call myself a overgrown monkey .
You are allowed to state where you 're from .
That is n't pride . That 's just a statement of fact .
I do n't think there 's anything massively wrong to to feel a sentimental pride towards your country ,
it is human nature to feel attached to where you come from .
It is nationalism that becomes an issue .
His jumping down your throat was his problem .
You 're from the UK and England so in my opinion which ever one you choose to identify yourself as you are correct .
You 've probably guessed what this one 's about !
In the 2001 census , the question of what people 's religious affiliations were , and many people decided to put " Jedi " in the hope that it would be recognised as an official religion .
It was n't . But 390,000 people decided tocall themselves Jedis anyway .
I 'm wondering what people make of this .
I kinda expected more Jedis to be out there , although in all honesty , I would say that I have n't actually seen anyone wielding a lightsaber , so that may be flawed .
I just thought that seven in every thousand people is a bit small , since the campaign was well - publicised , and there were no repurcussions for not telling the truth on the religion question .
So what does everyone else make of it ?
I know quite a few Jews put down " Jedi " on the census as they did n't want government records that they were Jewish - that 's how Hitler managed to find all the Jews so easily - it was all kept carefully on detailed and accurate notes .
It can be argued that it is none of the government 's concern as to where each Jew / Muslim / Sikh / Christian etc. lives ..
how would that affect GDP or the state of the economy ?
On the other hand it can be said that they should know who practices what as they run the country and can thus make laws according the proportionate numbers of each faith etc.
- As a Jew and having experienced anti - Semtism myself ( as many Jews have and do ) I would sway towards the former view in terms of safety , but I can understand why people would disagree with this and choose the latter .
Earlier this month the results from the 2011 British Social Attitudes Survey were published by the government .
The main finding , as mentioned in the title , is that for the first time a full 50 % of British people no longer associate themselves with any religion , and over half of the people that do affiliate with a religion never attend religious services or meetings , with only 14 % attending such events on a weekly basis .
It 's dying . Good .
I do n't really care either way , to be honest .
All this really proves is that the question on the census needs rewording .
Nice to see that those lacking a religion are now a majority , although thankfully UK Christians tend to be very reserved and moderate unlike their US counterparts .
Though undoubtedly many of the responses on this thread will still use the 2001 census as a reliable source for religious demographics despite the fact it 's ten years old .
Good .
Will be interesting to compare this to the census data when it 's released .
I am regaining my faith in humanity .
America next .
America is probably a lost cause , but I 'm pleased to see we 're going Scandinavian .
This is n't intrinsically an anti - islam thread .
Nor am I saying that other religions do n't have followers that do things that are similar and worse .
Today that 's not my focus .
Millions of lambs were ritually killed a short time ago .
Many Muslims making the claim that it was done in a way that is painless .
However , I 'm unsure of what is really going on .
Children were seen to be showing disrespect and a lack of caring .
Adults the same .
Even if you claim that animals and humans simply are n't equal , it does not justify harming them .
It would be like claim I am above someone else therefore I can do what I want to them .
It does n't make any sense .
This video shows the lambs , which appear to be in a great deal of pain , being killed .
My question is , how is that peaceful ?
Or justified ?
In this day and age in the western world it has become increasingly easy to be a vegan .
So why would you put animals intentionally through unnecessary pain and suffering ?
Graphic video in spoiler :
2 minutes in you see a lamb killed .
6.44 what looks like salt is put over where the wound will be . Will this not worsen the pain ?
During the Hajj , Muslims remember and commemorate the trials and triumphs of the Prophet Abraham ( as ) .
The meat from the sacrifice of Eid al-Adha is mostly given away to others although there is no limit to what may be eaten or given in charity or used to feed the poor or the rich or even if one wants to give it away cooked or uncooked .
Generally though , it is preferred that you give most of it in charity .
The method of slaughter is similar to the one used throughout the whole world , by Muslims and non - Muslims .
There are probably many variants though but considering one method " worse " than another is subjective .
The most important difference though is that in Islam , you are obligated to put the animal under as little pain as possible and to treat it humanely ( during the slaughter and every instant of it 's live before it ) .
Anyone who says halal ritual does not cause pain is a liar .
I have seen an animals throat slit and it survived and was in a lot of pain .
Ironically it was a pig that was being slaughtered .
I was in Cyprus and they slit its throat .
Before any Muslim says " it was n't done properly , " do n't talk that crap .
The cut was so deep I was surprised it was n't fully decapitated .
However the pig squealed in agony and was still running until it bled out .
I 'm sorry but its all a load of crap " halal doesnt cause pain "
If you have a problem with the slaughter of animals , you should be vegetarian and disapprove of all slaughter , which I assume you are .
Why this has anything to do with Islam and a festival where lambs are slaughtered for the poor in memory of Ibrahim 's ( Abraham 's ) loyalty to God I do not see .
Oh and btw , a few years ago I was in a town near my home city in India with my family for qurbani - and literally the people there were starving and malnourished beyond belief .
To such people , the pain of an animal is the last thing on their mind .
I only mention because it is so easy to view things from a Western first world perspective , which is why we also criticise Chinese fur farms where furs are stripped from animals when they are alive causing unbelievable pain for incredibly long extended periods , but to a Chinese family in the remote rural regions , it is their only source of bread and butter - and trust me , these people who really do not know whether they will get another meal ( unlike the gluttony we engage in 24/7 since birth here in the West ) think very differently from us - and justifiably so .
The recent case of the Christian pastor in Iran has given me cause to ponder the question in the thread title .
Here we have a man who knows that his life is in great peril if he refuses to recant his Christian faith , yet that is exactly what he does .
It goes without saying that his bravery is truly commendable .
His possible martyrdom parallels that of the Apostles who evangelised in the knowledge that what they were doing would likely get them killed .
I often wonder if I would be so brave if I were in their shoes
I love God more than anything , but it 's impossible to imagine what kind of pressure the pastor in Iran is under .
Would you sacrifice yourself in defence of your faith ?
yes , without doubt , yes I will sacrifice myself in defence of my faith .
God did sacrifice Himself for us , so I thought it 's sensible for us to sacrifice ourselves for our religion .
Even if I was religious I doubt I would ever die for my religion .
Whats the point ?
Do you think it gets you an automatic ticket to heaven ?
Is it going to change the mind of the one who killed you ?
What about your family and friends ?
If someone holds a gun to your head and demmands you recant , just f * * * ing do it !!
It doesnt mean anything , god isnt going to deny you access to heaven because you made a perfectly rational decision under intense pressure
I 've been watching some of his videos and I definitely think he has a right to criticize religion if he wants to .
But I find a lot of the time he makes such sweeping statements and sometimes unnecessary insults that annoy me .
What do you think of him and his videos ?
He 's a bit aggressive , raves and rants a lot , and mixes up a lot of different political stances into one bundle when many are in no way related , but beyond that ....
yeah , guy speaks a lot of truth .
Everytime when I watch him , I think to myself " Okay , we get it .
You hate Muslims .
And your point is .. ? " .
Just spotted the thread about the Patterson film , and looking over at it they 're seems to be some people claiming to not only believe in bigfoot but claim to have seen one , not im not sure if this is sarcasm , but what the hell ....
anyone seen a real life sasquatch ?
I 've seen an actual photograph of an actual person in an actual Bigfoot costume .
Does that count ?
For any who were n't already aware Huntster believes he came upon a sasquatch trackway and I while camping with friends on Vancouver Island several years ago found two sets of tracks and had a close range audio encounter with what at the time I attributed to sasquatch ( es - at the time I thought there was an adult and juvenile ) but now I discount the event as inconclusive and likely mistaken identity given the spurious nature of BF evidence .
However , I still fel pretty confident I could rule out hoaxing because of the remoteness of the area .
But hey , you never know ...
I actually surfed in after a year because I wanted to hear the JREF side on this issue . No one appears to have posted about this yet .
Apparently , the two folks that died paid nearly 10,000 dollars to attend the new age sweat led by two time Oprah guest .
James Arthur Ray - a non - Native American , lead over 60 people into the sweat ' lodge ' .
20 people became ill , and one more is still in critical condition tonight .
I just read about this story .
It 's a tragedy , and I also find it revealing that the New Age guru in question , Mr. Ray , has since left the state of Arizona .
From what I understand , it sounds like Ray did n't know what the hell he was doing , because he put entirely too many people in entirely too small a space .
In addition , they covered the lodge with materials that did n't allow for decent air flow .
Put all of that together , and you have a situation ripe for asphyxiation .
Apparently they are still wanting to question the guy .
They said he was uncooperative .
I do n't know much about the laws on this but would n't it be negligent homicide or something ?
This would be an interesting story to keep up with .
I have been searching for this story to no avail .
A few weeks ago me and a few friends watched a TV show on Discovery ( their house not mine ! ) where a guy claims to have recovered from a coma with a newfound ability ...
he can play the piano like an expert .
He says he ca n't write music , but he sees musical notes in his mind and he can " miraculously " play them seemingly perfect , or close to it .
He claims to have no musical training and has never played an instrument in his life .
My B.S. meter went off , of course .
Does anyone here have more information about this guy ?
I ca n't remember his name ... I think he is in the U.S.
I ca n't find anything on the web or here at JREF .
For musicians : I wonder how he would handle key signatures since he says the notes just fly by in his mind .
Are they notated as sharp or flat ?
Or is he stuck in C major forever ?
My off the cuff guess is that he played the piano before the coma .
Perhaps he is a failed musician and saw an opportunity to get into the limelight .
I would think people in his life would know that he could play previously , but as we all know , believers wo n't care , or simply claim that these people are lying .
The ability to play the Piano and other instruments to a high level not only involves technical ability but also physical training ( remember the first time you tried to span notes on a Guitar or piano ? )
How is it possible he woke with all his Piano playing muscles fully developed ?
Well in the case of the guy Sacks writes about , it was more a matter of waking up to a newfound passion for the piano , not that he woke a fully developed piano player .
He claims to have been a guy who listened to rock music before the accident , but afterward could n't get enough of piano music , started to sit down at a piano to play , and then more and more often , and then he was hearing music in his head , and it just became an obsession .
So nothing really mystical about it . The man himself seems to put a spiritual spin on it , but it makes sense all the same without it .
I 'd say it 's not impossible .
He seems to be playing by ear .
His music is unstructured ; it sounds like he 's just playing whatever comes into his head .
He 's not playing classical works like Mozart .
Also , I 'd say he 's self - taught at the very least .
Watch his hands .
He does n't hold them in the typical positions that most piano players are taught .
He looks like he 's just stabbing at the next note he wants to play .
It has been noted that there have been a lot of threads created on the topic of global warming .
A great number of these topics rapidly descend into bickering and other rule violations .
Although one of the biggest threads was put on moderated status , it seems that many of the other threads have sprung up in order to avoid moderated status .
That thread has now been closed .
Since many of the threads cover the same or similar ground , we 've decided to keep only this thread for general Global Warming discussions , which will be moderated .
Unless the topic is very different from the " general " discussion , new threads and posts about global warming will be moved to that thread if they satisfy the membership agreement .
Failure to confine general discussions to this moderated thread or starting other threads for general discussion will be treated as Rule 6 violations and subject to a series of escalating penalties just like any other membership violation .
We hope this will encourage civility in the discussion of global warming .
We realize this topic inspires strong emotion , but please contain your emotion to those forms which are permissible under the Membership Agreement .
I do n't know if you guys have followed potholer54 's channel on youtube , but his series of delightfully devastating and withering videos on climate science and creationism are something to behold .
The latest in the series looks at the " scientists " that represent the denialist side in the climate " debate "
I 'm aware of realclimate.org , have read a few articles and what not over the last few months .
The response was of course tongue and cheek , a commentary on the nonsense that you ca n't have a meaningful discussion without hot links .
Hoepfully this new thread will promote just such discussions .
I do n't see how , short of turning to nuclear entirely , how we can reduce CO 2 levels without sequestering and GE .
Not only that , but if you believe the current models to be accurate , we need to reduce the effects of CO 2 now .
So this could have been in the science , music , or current events forum and if any mods should choose to move it , that will be fine with me .
I 'm watching the Grammys and they 've put on a tribute to Glenn Campbell including Campbell singing Rhinestone Cowboy .
And in the tribute they announce he has Alzheimer 's .
It amazes me that people are being diagnosed when they still have enough thought capacity to discuss their fate .
Being rich , I hope he gets to try the new treatment recently successfully used on mice .
I would .
It 's a drug currently approved for chemotherapy in humans .
This will be remarkable if it pans out .
So why did I post this and make it about Glenn Campbell instead of just about the science ?
I do n't know .
It just struck me hearing the announcement Campbell had Alzheimer 's at the same time he was still well enough to appear on stage at the Grammy 's .
It 's weird .
And the discovery of a treatment that is a drug already approved for use in humans should make a bit different of a pathway for research .
If you were wealthy or simply had access to the drug , and had Alzheimer 's would you use it immediately instead of waiting for conclusive studies ?
I had this discussion with Linda ( fls ) in the past and I really wish she had n't left the forum because i 'd like to use this example to revisit the discussion .
I ca n't speak for her but I got the impression she would wait for the research to be more conclusive .
I use the criteria : if it is not harmful and there is some evidence it might work , and if there is no better alternative , I think it is worth trying .
In this case it is the potential benefit and lack of any alternative treatment and the fact Alzheimer 's is such a devastating terminal disease that it outweighs the fact the research is premature .
What say the rest of you ?
I 'd do it in a heartbeat .
Our brain is who we are , and without memories we are just animals .
You risk almost nothing , to gain everything .
My feeling is that when I grow old enough that I 've " had a good run , " why not donate my body to science before I die ?
If I have some disease that will kill me in a few months or years anyway , then , by all means , experiment on me with some new drug that has potential .
And if I have some issue that wo n't kill me for awhile , well , what the hell if the new drug causes some side effects ?
I can always stop taking it .
Either way , there is some chance that I 'll help people younger than I am.
And once I die , then take my body and do whatever is useful with it .
I do n't need it anymore .
I am my mind .
At age 72 , with the possibility of Alzheimer 's looming in my future , I would take any supplement or drug -- experimental or otherwise -- that may prevent or delay this dreaded condition .
Obviously I would avoid anything demonstrably and seriously harmful .
Many conjectures like NSAIDs , simvastatin , fish oil have come and gone .
I have and will continue to try them all until they are proven ineffective or seriously harmful .
Precious little news on developments .
Last I saw Russian scientists were saying that they may have reached the surface .
I am frankly about as interested in this as is humanly possible .
Though I expect that little will be found outside of micro - organisms , I have hopes that there will be discoveries similar to those around the black smokers .
My kids are hoping for Cthulhu .
They may have to wait until after Xmas .
A bit of an anticlimax considering the conversation we had on the subject last year ,
Much more gripping than this thread mate !
The huge interconnected lakes about two miles below antarctic ice ca n't be touched because they must be under enormous pressure .
I would think that to drill into them would cause a collapse of hundreds of miles of ice , erupting water , flooding and wiping out area the size of Victoria ?
As is usual at JREF , much hilarity and education then ensued ...
Anxiety and inattention over Tokyo 's next Big One
It points out that a magnitude 7 earthquake is actually 1000 times smaller in terms of energy released that the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that caused the tsunami last year .
However , the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 which killed over 100,000 was a 7.9 .
And , I 'm pretty sure they do n't mean that this earthquake will be exactly magnitude 7 .
It could be bigger .
Still , I think that Tokyo is more earthquake - resistant today than it was in 1923 .
So , I guess I 'll take my chances .
Take your chances ? !
What do you live in Tokyo ?
Curious ... do other Earthquake agencies agree with the data from Tokyo ?
I would like to know what scale they 're using , because different seismic scales can result in enormously different results .
A perfect example is the two largest Christchurch earthquakes .
The first was M 7 + but did only minor damage and caused no fatalities due to a low Mercalli Intensity reading ( actual measure of intensity of shaking in a particular place ) .
The second M 6.3 quake registered at X ( Intense ) and higher on the Mercalli Intensity scale and had the highest peak ground acceleration ever recorded .
Many seismologists have said that the quake would have completely flattened almost any city in the world .
In terms of energy released , the deadly Christchurch quake was not particularly big , but in terms of shaking intensity it was one of the most destructive quakes ever recorded .
Japan 's " Shindo " scale is like the Mercalli Intensity Scale , but does n't have anywhere near as many divisions .
The highest category is 7 which seems to equate with VIII on the Mercalli scale ( it goes up to XII ) .
This basically means a Scale 7 quake could be anything from a decently sized but not overly destructive quake right up to a city - leveling event .
I heard this term for a single world currency .
Why is it that CTs seem to think this is a threat ?
We ca n't even get 2.5 political parties to agree on fundamental economic principles .
There 's no reason to believe that we could get the US , Mexico and Canada to ever agree on a common currency .
Plus , the Euro zone is showing strains around the edges , so now would be a very bad time to try .
So why do you guys think the US invaded Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Do you think our leaders really thought Iraq had WMD ?
And do you think they actually cared ?
Who benefited from the war ?
Which industries , which money / power interests , which lobbying groups , etc ?
Why is the US posturing so strongly against Iran ?
Are they really concerned about WMDs ?
What would Iran do with WMDs that would scare the US so much ?
Iran taking great control and spreading rebellion against US ?
Regional arms race ?
Iran using the bomb ?
America had been toying with the idea of " revisiting " Iraq ever since the first war ended , particularly in 1998 , when Saddam first started getting coy with the inspectors .
It did n't get much traction then because America was , at the time , experiencing a resurgance of isolation after the end of the Cold War .
The issues were the same then , but Bush found the post - 9/11 America a bit more ameniable to the idea of war .
Oil , WMDs , Al Queda , these were all simply McGuffins .
The real reason is that Saddam was a petty dictator who weilded an inordinate amount of influence and was continually giving the impression that he was Up To Something .
Whether he actually was or not was n't the point .
Be careful of special interest groups hijacking the message .
That 's what happened to the Tea Party leading them to be co - opted into the Fox News GOP .
Even if people show up who you agree with on some political issue , ask yourselves if that issue is actually related to what the protest is about .
There will be , and probably already are , many factions who want nothing more than to turn the entire movement into a DNC fundraiser .
Suddenly it will be about collective bargaining for teachers or something else that does n't involve a corporation at all , let alone Wall Street .
The partisans on both sides will try and expand their trenches such that your movement falls into them .
Keep an eye out , do n't be the next Tea Party .
What identity ?
It 's a collection of every wingnut cause out there , from Ron Paultards to communists to anarchists to anti - Israel to people who like to dress as zombies .
They want more government , less government , more immigration , protectionism , etc etc.
They protest corporations even as they organize on Facebook and Twitter and Youtube using laptop computers and smart phones , all fruits of corporations .
They rail against oil companies while powering generators with gasoline .
They want to end capitalism , while also getting better pay .
What entity will pay them absent capitalism I have no idea .
Kids throwing a temper tantrum , basically .
They interviewed some of them on NPR the other day .
One guy admitted they did n't have a cohesive message and he was n't sure if they could have one considering the disparate groups that were there .
He also acknowledged the irony of using large corporations like Verizon to get the message out and using the McDonalds to go to the bathroom .
The New York Times printed an opinion piece by a Mr Eric X. Lee which asserts China 's political system is superior to Americas .
I do n't know if they though they were being edgy , but that 's a pretty stupid thing to print .
What next ?
Islamic attitudes to women superior to the West 's ?
You think people should only print that which toes the party line ?
Why was it a " stupid thing to print " - opinion pieces as far as I know are meant to be opinions and it may surprise some folk but not everyone holds the same opinions as they do .
Given that news papers often print opinion pieces to raise interest in their title it seems that it is far from being a pretty stupid thing to print as we are talking about the newspaper ...
Yeah , your thread title rather gives a misleading opinion about the NYT Virus .
I 'm sure that was a complete accident of course .
I hear all sorts of perspectives on marriage . Those who think monogamy is the proper standard , those who think monogamy is a tool used to oppress women , those who think that polygamy is terrible , those who think that polygamy is natural , etc.
But virtually ever culture in the world has some form of marriage ... a concept in which a life - long union is idealized , where there are formal ceremonies to ' sanctify ' a man and a woman ( or multiples thereof ) . Cultures where , from childhood , children are raised and taught these ideals to the point where most of us think it is a natural part of human nature .
The FORM of marriage may differ from culture to culture , but it is consistent throughout our cultures .
That is , except for at least one very unique culture , the Mosuo , a Chinese minority group who live in the Himalayan mountains , close to the border with Tibet .
Two years ago , I established a non - profit organization to work with the Mosuo , focusing on a variety of aspects ( education , development , etc. ) , but also on promoting awareness of their culture , and to trying to preserve it .
In the Mosuo culture , there is no marriage .
No marriage ceremonies exist .
There is no expectation whatsoever of life - time bonds or pairings .
Children are raised not only without an expectation of spending their life with that one special person , but they often do n't even know ( or care ) who their biological father is .
In the Mosuo culture , men and women can change and choose partners as they please .
Monogamy is not considered special or even particularly desirable .
The Mosuo live in large extended families , with many generations ( grandparents , parents , children , grandchildren , etc. ) all living together in the same house .
Men sleep in communal sleeping rooms ( they do n't have private bedrooms ) ; only the women have the luxury of a private bedroom .
Thus , women tend to the the ones in control of relationships .
Traditionally , a Mosuo woman will invite a man to spend the night with her .
The man will come to her home at night , sneaking in through her window ( it is also a part of the Mosuo culture that , while everyone knows this is happening , it should be done in a manner that is not obvious ) , spending the night , and then leaving early the next morning before everyone wakes up .
Thus the term " walking marriage " ... because the men must walk to and from their assigned rendevous each night .
The Mosuo walking marriages are generally the most interesting -- and misunderstood -- aspects of Mosuo culture .
People are always fascinated by it , but misunderstandings and misperceptions abound .
One of the most common misperceptions is that the Mosuo are very promiscuous , changing partners all the time .
That is patently not true ; in fact , many Mosuo pairing will last for years , and even decades .
There is no social stigma if someone DOES change partners often , but it is more common for the Mosuo to engage in what has been described as " serial monogamy " ... that is , they do n't stick with one partner for their whole life , but each pairing will tend to last for an extended period , and they wo n't generally have multiple partners while in a relationship .
However , there are fascinating and very unique aspects of these walking marriages .
First , even among couples who are together for months / years / decades , they generally will never actually live together , or share property .
The man will continue to live in his family 's home , and his responsibilities are to that family ; while the woman will continue to live her her home , and be responsible to her family .
The man will visit her at night , but the rest of the time they generally live separate lives .
And what if they have a baby ? In general , fathers have little or no responsibility for children produced from such unions ;
the baby will be raised in the mother 's home , and be a part of her family , not the father 's .
However , that does not mean that the men have no responsibility ... it is just that the focus of that responsibility is shifted .
In most cultures , a man will be responsible to care for his own children ;
in Mosuo culture , a man is responsible to care for the children of his sisters / nieces / aunts / etc. So Mosuo men still have full parenting responsibilities ... perhaps even moreso , since they may end up sharing responsibility for the children of many family members .
Now , in some cases , Mosuo men DO want to be involved in their own childrens ' upbringing .
If that is the case , after the child is born , the father will go to the mother 's home , and present the family matriarch with gifts , asking to be accepted as the father .
If the matriarch accepts him , he is then an ' honorary member ' of the family , and has the right to visit and / or stay there like any other family member , and to help raise the child .
However , this is not a frequent practice .
Although this sounds very strange at first , it actually provides remarkable stability for the children .
First , they are not raised by just one parent ; everyone in the family shares in parental duties , so the child really ends up having multiple father and mother figures .
Furthermore , if the mother and father end their relationship , there is virtually no impact or stress for the child .
There 's no fighting over splitting property , because they never shared property .
There 's no fighting over custody of the child , because the child never belonged to the father to begin with .
The mother 's relationships with different men may change , but it has little or no effect on the children .
One more thing I 'd like to point out . While this system actually works very effectively for the Mosuo , it works ONLY in a situation where there is a large extended family to provide support .
For those Mosuo men and women who leave home to live / work on their own in other cities , they almost always choose more traditional marriage .
After all , caring for a baby without its father when you have 20 other people in your home to help you is one thing ;
caring for a baby without its father when you live by yourself is another matter entirely .
For more information about the Mosuo , their culture , and our work with them , you can check out our organization 's website . And I welcome questions and comments about this , or other aspects of Mosuo culture .
While their way of life holds no particular allure to me ( my job consists of sitting , writing on paper and thinking about things , I am allergic to horses , my greatest joy is my western traditional family of my wife and 2 daughters ) I applaud your efforts to provide as unobtrusive assistance to these people as possible .
Diversity of cultures and thinking is a Good Thing , and I like your organizations emphasis on putting them in control .
I would suggest that you do n't worry about people who suggest that you try to protect them somehow from the outside world .
If the Mosuo do n't want you or your organization 's help , I am sure they are quite capable of telling you to get lost .
When you say " we " are doing this , who is " we " ?
In particular , have you hooked up with the various groups like the LSA and the Endangered Languages Foundation ?
There 's a lot -- well , by linguistics standards , a lot -- of money floating around for doing exactly this , and it sounds like Mosuo is one language that might be saveable if you can bring it to the attention of the appropriate professionals .
So depending upon who the linguists you are bringing in are , it may be possible / practical to get some real heavyweights to come in for their support ....
Wolfman , sounds like you 're doing some amazing work !
The Mosuo sound like a fascinating people .
Matrilineal systems are indeed rather rare .
I think there used to be ( ) some in Polynesia .
I do n't know if property was owned by females but it was transferred through the female line ( a man 's heirs would be his sister 's children ) .
I think some of the Native American tribes in the U.S. plains were also matrilineal .
Very interesting . What this shows , I think , is that while there is no marriage , there is also no illegitimacy -- that is , most children ( a ) know who their fathers are ( and the fathers do not deny it , even if they have no role in caring for them ) and ( b ) have two male and female adults ( mother and her brother ) take care of them .
Also , it 's easy to see why this social arrangement will discourage promiscuity .
In general , most men will be responsible for raising , roughly , the same number of children as they have , even if they do n't raise their own children .
However , if you are a man who has too many partners -- or , more important , too many children -- you are probably seen as a freeloader : someone who makes society take care of their many children while only caring for a few of society 's children in return .
Am I correct here ?
You 're the expert , I 'm just making an educated ( ? ) guess .
You have to wonder why this is not big news and her hearings kinda faded out of the spotlight ...
could it be that there was this long drawn out leak that was going to end the world in the gulf , that this administration seemed hell bent on letting continue ? lol
I am sure their genitalia will make a lot of difference when ti comes time to make a decision ...
I do n't remember much balleyhoo when the second black was elevated to the bench but then ......
I 've enabled multiple choice for this poll because I 'd like you to select which 3 candidates will finish in the top 3 in New Hampshire .
The New Hampshire primary is just 5 days away .
In the average of the last 4 polls there it looks like this :
Romney 40 %
Paul 19 %
Gingrich 11 %
Huntsman 10 %
Santorum 4 %
Perry 2 %
In two of the more recent polls , between 35-40 % of NH voters say they are either " likely to change their mind " or " undecided / uncommitted " .
What are your vote predictions for next Tuesday ?
I 'm gonna ramble a bit and then reveal mine .
The consensus appears to be that Mitt Romney needs a big win in NH in order to propel him in SC since his Iowa result was almost to the vote the same total as 2008 .
No new support for Mitt .
In '08 , Mitt finished 2nd to McCain in NH and got 32 % of the vote .
How much of that 40 % right now is hardcore Romney support ?
Inexplicably , he avoided an onslaught of attacks over the last few weeks as the focus turned on Newt , but now one of the big questions becomes about what Republicans really think about the idea of Mitt cleaning up in NH and quite possibly everywhere else , too .
I think NH is a test of how comfortable or not Republicans are with Mitt as the presumptive front - runner .
I think that like Iowa , he 'll hold on to the support in NH he got last time .
So he 'll come down to earth a little bit but wo n't totally implode there .
Everybody needs to see the Iowa speeches .
Newt 's was fiery and disgruntled .
He 's so much more interesting when he 's an attack dog and he is positioning himself now as wanting to be the fullback to Rick Santorum ; if he 's going down , he wants to take Romney with him , and in the meantime that 'll let Santorum have a positive week and float above the fray .
Rick Santorum is leaving evangelical country and going into a 60 % Catholic state .
Between hard right establishment Catholics there and that close to 40 % undecided number , Santorum should be able to get into double digits .
But how high does he go ?
I think if Mitt comes down to the low 30 's and it appears that Santorum keeps coming up and can crack 25 % again , it 'll be another soft - boiled Mitt non - win win .
If Newt and Santorum now represent the more traditional GOP establishment and are fighting over that share in NH , Ron Paul and John Huntsman are sharing the Independent vote .
Will Huntsman be NH 's Santorum ?
Ron Paul appears ready to keep cruising around 20 % and another top 3 finish .
Rick Perry is totally insignificant and should have quit along with Michele Bachmann .
Romney 's ahead by an average of 21 % .
That 's going to come down to earth , but how much , and how much before it 's perceived that he 's falling and somebody else is rising ?
I think the threshold is that he needs to win by 10 % in order to gain any kind of traction as the front - runner .
In Iowa , my predictions ( actual results in parenthesis ) were pretty close :
Santorum 27 % ( 25 )
Romney 26 % ( 25 )
Paul 22 % ( 22 )
Gingrich 9 % ( 13 )
Perry 8 % ( 10 )
Bachmann 5 % ( 5 )
That was with a day or so out .
This is more of a crapshoot at this point but here goes .
Romney 32 %
Santorum 25 %
Paul 21 %
Huntsman 11 %
Perry 1 %
I 'm thinking it 's going to be Romney and Paul with a considerable lead , and Gingrich a distant third .
I would be distinctly and pleasantly surprised if Huntsman made the top three and absolutely tickled pink if he won , but I do n't see it happening .
Huntsman 's going to have to get some notice at the debate to finish in the top 3 .
If the others are attacking themselves like children , than maybe he can come up the middle and seem like the adult in the room and then NH will make a statement by elevating him to the anti - Romney surging candidate in that state .
I feel like it 's going to be tough for him to break out .
You are probably right , Romney and Paul for sure , but once the light shines on Santorum , the NH voters are n't going to like what they see .
I still see three voting blocks , Romney , Paul and Someone Else .
Huntsman has n't had a turn being Someone Else yet , and he 's more appealing to NH voters than Santorum .
Romney by a big number , because he lives in NH in a palatial home on Lake Winnipesaukee , and he 's been working on this primary for 5 years .
Paul because he 'll draw a lot of independent voters , and I think Gingrich is fading along with Perry .
This is all going down to how much the anti - Romney vote starts to close the divide .
In the Suffolk poll for Wednesday , it was Romney 43 % and Santorum 6 % .
Today it 's a two - day total now of 41 % to 8 % .
From a 37 point gap to a 33 point gap . Now , if it 's 37 points after one day , but the two - day total is 33 , that means the second - day stand alone would be 39 to 10 , a 29 point gap .
Meanwhile , Huntsman is down in the two - day total back to single digits .
Santorum 's small bump so far has costed Newt the most .
Watch for him to hit the double digits in the next couple polls .
Ron Paul is sailing with his strong 20 % .
I think the video below from a Charlie Chaplin movie is one of the best pieces that could be superimposed and run as a Ron Paul ad .
I would love to see something like this run on national television .
It 's a preaching to the choir ad .
It has no place on television because it does n't speak to the undecideds .
Near the end you could replace the " Ron Paul " chants with any other candidate and it would have the same effect .
There 's nothing in it that speaks of Paul 's views or intended policies .
Lastly , negative ads are far more effective than positive ones .
1940 . And still is relevent today .
The ideal Chaplin espouses here , will never die , and only get pushed back , to arise again .
Humanity can indeed be thankful for that , that we only go through stages of insanity , and have the chance of overcoming that .
This SHOULD be an ad for Obama .
But he would have to cut his ties to the greedy .
His ties to the ones behind the curtain , calling the shots .
Yet this thread is about Paul , so never mind .
I keep hearing tons of people run off at the mouth about how dangerous Ron Paul 's foreign policies are and how they are out of touch with the real world .
The problem is that all the people who would be considered experts , and even Israel itself ( in regards to Iran ) , agree with Paul .
I 've been on two deployments and my job is an Arabic linguist of 10 years .
I 'm fairly knowledgeable about how the culture works in that part of the world , as is many of the experts .
Our interference does , indeed , cause more problems for us than what we are trying to stop .
We supported the rebels in Egypt and it 's now being taken over by radicals .
Who knows where Libya is going to end up .
Anyways , are all the experts kooky as well ?
I find that the Judge is actually one of a few mainstream conservatives that has a shred of honesty and actually understand what conservatism is .
If someone had only bombed the reactors in Israel and South Africa , while the US and other countries had prosecuted and imprisoned all the traitors who leaked nuclear weapons information and gave the necessary technology to them ...
The US is largely directly to blame for the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its " Atoms for Peace " program .
But back on topic , if Ron Paul is " kooky " then so are most other politicians in any country on the planet .
And that is certainly true with most of our supposed allies .
911 was blowback from us sticking our nose in business that is not our business .
With that said , I still want to kill anyone who is responsible in the planning , or anyone who shields these people .
No one in the right mind would think the attackers just did it for shits and giggles .
They thought they had valid reasons to attack us . And perhaps they did .
America is not perfect .
They were hoping to wound us gravely by attacking our financial system . A weak link in our chain .
They should have just saved those lives , because we allowed banking to fuck our system up greater than AQ could have ever done .
Leave it up to us , to be our worst enemy .
I think that a lot of people automatically assume that anyone who says our foreign policy is why they are angry at us is also justifying their response .
It is understandable they are upset , but neither Ron Paul nor anyone else who is supporting him is saying their response was in any way justified .
Indiscriminately targeting women and children is cowardly and people who do that should be captured or killed .
I really am tired of hearing that they hate us because we are free or because of our beliefs .
It would be like you building a shack in my backyard and every now and then one of my dogs goes missing , then when I get upset that it is there you say I am mad because you have bacon burger Fridays in your own house back on your property and I hate bacon ( which is clearly only a hypothetical as I love bacon ) .
Why ? Because experts do n't agree with him on his kooky policy stands , which are manifold :
* denounces the Civil Rights Act because it infringed the free - market right of a monolithic white establishment to immiserate blacks ;
* dabbles in gold buggery and advocates the elimination of the Federal Reserve , apparently because the global economy worked so well back in the era before central banks ( that 's called sarcasm ) ;
* suggests that the border fence is being built to keep Americans from leaving the country ;
* claims that Social Security and Medicare are unconstitutional and should be dismantled ;
* mounts repeated warnings that hyperinflation is right around the corner ( tsquare , take a bow ) ;
* insists that global warming is a gigantic hoax ( yes , Rush Limbaugh knows more about global climate science than NASA ;
* hinted that maybe the CIA helped to coordinate the 9/11 attacks ;
* opposes government - sponsored flu shots ;
* and alleges that the UN wants to confiscate our guns .
( list adapted from th is blog )
And this list does n't even get into all the racism and homophobia of his newsletters , which used his name , were signed by him and which raised thousands of dollars which he was happy to pocket but have been disavowed by him now that they are a liability .
Note that none of this lists mentions our relations with Iran .
There 's lots of kookiness without having to go there .
Are you a communist ?
My friend and I walked into a pizza shop .
It was $ 3 a slice .
They had a special , a 12 - slice for $ 10 .
If we both got two slices each , that would make it 4 slices at a total of $ 12 .
We were assured the slices in the 12 - slice were the same size , so we got that .
We each pitched in $ 5 each ( which ca n't even buy you two slices oddly enough ) and got 6 slices each , which we 've just polished off in fairly record time .
We pooled our resources and struck the better deal for the both of us , and we actually made a joke about proud and full communists .
Now we 're rolling a joint from a bag of weed we each pitched in on in order to save money as well .
Got our usual amount of weed each , but each paid $ 5 less because one of us did the transaction and bought twice as much as usual for the individual .
If these things make me a communist , than I 'll drink to that , but I just call it better business sense mostly .
Real communism would be they could go get a pizza without paying at all , and the pizza guy could come by their auto - parts place to pick up a distributor cap without paying at all .
Real communism only exists in Israel 's Kibbutzes though .
The problem you are having Jason Marcel is that it is impossible for many people , and especially people in America , to conceive of cooperation and sacrifice without force behind it .
They are so locked into their little me - centric universes that they ca n't see cooperating with someone else unless someone makes them .
Seriously , I think the problem here is that a lot of people in the U.S. , conservatives especially , when they hear the word " communism " think of the Soviet Union .
Not only was the Soviet Union not communist , it did n't even pretend to be .
The word refers in Marxist theory only to the end stage of social progress , what a socialist state and economy evolve into : a stateless utopia in which everything is shared equally .
When communism is reached , socialism is no more , because socialism presumes the existence of the state , and under communism there is no state .
The motto under socialism is " from each according to his ability , to each according to his WORK . " Under communism , it 's the more - familiar , " from each according to his ability , to each according to his NEED . "
The Soviet Union was socialist .
It never pretended to be communist , even though it was governed by something called the Communist Party .
Communism was what they were in theory evolving towards , but certainly not what they already had .
Communism is not a coercive system ; it 's the exact opposite .
Neither the private coercion of capitalism , nor the state coercion of socialism is found in a communist society .
If it were possible to have a communist society , it would be a wonderful thing .
EDIT : I answered " no " to the poll , because although communism is a beautiful dream , I consider it no more than that .
What do you guys think about a Ron Paul run for president in 2012 .
Though he 's kind of old , he is still sharp and incredibly intelligent - and consistent .
His voting record is very consistent and he does n't vote for any legislation that is n't expressly allowed by the Constitution .
Given this , the grassroots support he had in 2008 , and the fact that his message is very closely aligned with that of the tea party movement , do think he could head either a tea party ( or more likely ) GOP ticket .
I really think given Paul 's astoundingly consistent message and voting record ( and reputation ) that he could mount a serious challenge to Obama . W
hat do you guys think ?
The role of leader of the free world is not well filled by an isolationist .
Paul / Palin , has a nice ring to it .
Once again the Republican solution is a geriatric nut , only this time it 's a relgious fanatic instead of senile warmonger .
I wonder , will Hillary be too old in 2016 ?
Hillary wo n't be " too old " in 2016 , but she will still be too Hillary .
Habemus Papademos !
Finally after days of intense political infight in Athens the new prime minister seems to be the biggest favourite for the job : Lucas Papademos .
He is an ex - ECB vice president .
But foremost he is not a career politician as his profession is actually an academic one , partly in the US where he also studied .
Papademos seems to be well respected in the EU but also within Greece , as far as a Greek Prime minister could be respected in a country like Greece where being politician has a worse reputation than being a bank robber .
I am positively surprised about this choice .
At least someone took over who has an understanding of economics in quite some detail and is not from the old political class .
I do n't think one could have hoped for anything better than that .
On another note . There are rumors that Mario Monti could become the next prime minister of Italy .
Monti , also dubbed " Super Mario " , is a former EU commissioner and will still ring some bells for example in Redmond , simply because it was him who did not shy away from taking a fight with an extreme heavyweight like Microsoft over anti - trust issues .
( Same goes for companies like VW etc ) .
If both news would be true , this would make the dark horizon look a little less dark indeed .
These two men would be the best choice for their respective countries in times like these in my humble opinion .
They know economics , have a reputation of being not involved in corruption , dare to do what they believe has to be done and are convinced Europeans .
The ex head of the ECB takes over at the helm of the world 's most financially trouble country and you are " positively " surpised ?
Personally i was hoping for Eva Kaili , but obviously for different reasons .
He was n't the head of the ECB but one of the Vice Presidents , ie in the governing council of the ECB . For all the shortcomings of the Euro , I ca n't see how the ECB has done a bad job .
He seems to be a really clever guy , understanding economics like few prime ministers in the world probably , as he teaches it in Harvard I think .
Eva Kaili would have been a great choice .
Well at least it would have made the newspapers look more interesting ...
Well , she 's not the most attractive woman in the world but for a politician there are n't many hotter out there ...
she must get lost in my posts , what with the other women and all .
I think i have a thing for blonde women ...
anyhow , so seeing as i can find myself talking positively about a socialist like this , is n't it your turn to talk about Palin like this in threads about the Tea Party ?
Btw , i think given her experience in journalism and TV media , she would have done a good job relaying the message of what the essential need of bailout measures were , to the Greek people .
She also was very respectful in her final days of dissent in the previous coallition , and did n't even call for him to resign .
That i can respect .
It 's a very good idea to have a former ECB man in the job .
We have too many bureaucrats and lawyers and career politicians in charge of economic matters .
It is good to see someone with economic experience .
I think I 'm one of those who likes watching the Superbowl for all the new ads .
Ferris Bueller was alright and Seinfeld was pretty funny , but Clint Eastwood 's ad for Chrysler makes them the winner two years in a row after Eminem 's wicked ad for them last year .
I believe Eastwood is speaking from the heart , that 's why I think it 's such an amazing and curious ad since it looks and feels so much like the kind of thing the Obama campaign would find favorable to them .
Clint Eastwood is a lifelong moderate conservative .
Fiscal conservative , social libertarian .
Voted for Nixon twice because the man promised to end the war .
His first vote was for Eisenhower .
He endorsed John McCain last time out .
Has n't endorsed anyone in that field yet , but says he likes Ron Paul .
He says he would n't call himself a hardcore conservative or an extreme lefty .
From the stuff he is for and against in recent years , it paints a picture of the kind of voter that will decide the election , and I think Eastwood taps into that feeling of wanting to make a comeback happen .
There 's something to be gained by this guy 's performance , a man of rugged self - reliance who also took the time to acknowledge in the ad that " we all pulled together " , his tip of that of course to the bailouts which he is supportive of .
The candidate who will win the election is the one who can tap into that emotion too .
Great ad .
Its half time in america and beer costs more because alcohol tax increases , your so hapy to be here at the game instead of your crowded house ( it 's been packed since your brother - inlaw lost his job and home ) , your credit card bill is going to be major after the game , homeland security will be investigating you because of a glitch in the facial i.d. software at the enterance , your job is being outsourced next wek , your team is losing millions in endorsements , a major corporation paid millions to sell their foreign made wares to you for justt a few seconds , and your car is being repoed in the lot .
We need voters that are n't swayed by gimmicky corporate ads .
I loved the ad till I saw that it was for Chrysler . Considering they are owned by Fiat , " Imported from Detroit " is a good slogan .
Still a good ad , no matter who made it .
Loved the Volkswagen one too .
There were high expectations , considering all the prices they won with the Darth Vader one last year , but I think they managed to pull it off .
I do n't even know what a Fiat is but after last night 's commercial I 'm buying two .
I have a hankering to send someone flowers via Teleflora too .
All and all , I thought it was a very down year for Super Bowl commercials and I did n't even notice the Chrysler one .
It was a bit too political for my tastes but I do n't really care if car companies want to spend a fortune on Obama ads .
I 'm a happy camper as along as I 'm allowed to cast my vote for who I think is the better candidate and make my annual political contribution of $ 0.00 to all campaigns .
Old Clint was inspirational .
At one time the repubs would have thought so as well .
But they have become infected , and are really sick .
Emotionally and mentally sicker than anyone has been in this nation in my lifetime .
They are not team players , they are so individualistic that it has become detrimental to the nation pulling together , working together .
They have taken individualism to a degree that it goes against the evolution of one of the most social animals in the world , the human being .
And " sharing " is seen by them as socialism .
It really is sad , in its most basic sense , because it hinders fixing what their " every man is an Island " philosophy that is tearing apart the fabric of society .
Forget Guantanimo , forge the Gulags , the CHOGM 2011 opening that Australia made the Queen and various sundry Heads of State sit through was just plain EVIL .
I always assume these sort of things are appalling .
If the Queen was n't turning up this would n't have much coverage here .
A bunch of foreign looking folk all in one place only gets coverage if a crime is committed ( they 'll get blamed , even if they are the victim ) .
There has been a small amount of coverage of Mr Rajapaksa 's problems , but since the government is n't going to charge him wiht anything it goes under the category of ' Greens bluster ' .
Do n't you wish duelling was still legal .
It would solve so many problems .
Imagine Netanyahu challenging Ahmadinejad to a duel at the UN .
And Ahmadinejad will have Chavez as his second .
Oh , happy thought ..
Actyooally , if a debt of honor is to be solved , there is no problems with , behind the tank sheds at 4 or behind the bike sheds after school , fisticuffs gadzooks , or in politico , s circles , in the duty free binge drinking bar in the house of commons .
I was hoping for dueling between members of rival street gangs .
I 'll even provide nice hollow point ammo for them to use .
Or something like the Thunderdome .
Two men enter , one man leaves .
Mary Travers , part of the trio of Peter , Paul and Mary died yesterday after battling leukemia for many years .
I grew up listening to their music and got the chance to see them perform when I lived in VA.
I remember this group , and love some of their songs .
It was in the 1960s .
Puff the Magic Dragon ...
I can never hear that song without imagining an AC - 47 or AC - 130 type gunship lazily swinging around in a constant circle , with sci - fi lasergun - looking tracers pouring out like evil glowing rain ...
No wonder those grade school psychiatrists were baffled .
Hey folks - I just found out that Debbie had an apparently small fire at her house this morning .
I just talked to her and she 's home and physically fine and dealing with the immediate aftermath so was too busy to talk .
I do n't know when she 'll have or use internet access in the next couple of days , but for those folks wondering who they could wish well this week , you now have a target .
That poor girl has busted her ass fixing up her house and installing a new heater and wood stove for the last six months and probably longer .
That really sucks ! : (
I hope she is ok and the house is still livable in especially since she encountering very cold weather and considering where she lives and all .
Thank Dale for letting us know and please do tell her were thinking about her . : (
Personally , I think they should peg it to inflation so that the pension has the same general purchasing power over time , but I know that economically it would be a disaster as people are living more and more into their older years , far past when people would traditionally die .
The retirement age has not increased , but the amount of time on retirement has .
Eventually , the military will do away with retirement benefits , or at least certain aspects of them .
It is not the British alone .
Ask me .
That is life .
They use you and then discard you !
Sooner one understands that , one shall remain happy .
I am happy !
Yet if the govt does away with retirement benefits the world over , there will be peace .
None will serve !
Army , you had me worried there for a minute as " they should peg it " means to die .
Service Pensions are " pegged " to inflation but usually capped to 2 % ish per annum , not much more .
Servicemen should be recieving .. Service Pension and State pension and if they are lucky a Works pension .
Times are hard and the forecast for the near future does not look too rosy .
The retirement age in the UK is due to rise in the future , at the moment retirement is 65 and Government wants to raise it to 70 .
I must say I also have little sympathy in this case .
Assuming h retired out of choice and was not wounded , then it really is your own responsibility to handle your finances in my opinion .
The forces are just a job like any other after all .
This very thing was driven home during my first retirement class .
In the USMC you are required to attend the first day of a week long retirement seminar .
The other days are optional .
But your choice not your units .
Around the middle of the day , the leader of the seminar started asking us if we were coming back the next day .
About 70 % ( almost all combat arms guys ) said " No , We have things we need to do at our unit . "
He said you all spent at least 20 yrs doing things for the Corps . Now take a week for yourself and be informed before you retire .
If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door talk to a retiree .
No one from HQMC will call you to see how things are going .
No one will call you a month later to see if you have a job yet or if there is anything they can help you with .
And you know what ?
No one ever did in an official capacity .
The only thing I ever got from them was a " We want you to come back on active duty as a full time reservist . "
You will have to give up your retirement and disability payments .
Once we are done with you the retirement checks wo n't start again until your 65 since you will be considered a reservist .
And you will have to start over from square 1 with the VA.
The Corps needs you , do n't let us down . "
I had better things to do .
i think I let them down .
All aboard are reported safe .
Aircraft dropped in an apparent decompression state with passengers on oxygen from 40K in a controlled dive .
Cause of the hole is unknown , aircraft is not old , being delivered in 1991 .
I 'm sure that it must have been alarming for all concerned .
The hole is enormous .
I flew out of Hong Kong last week .
:( That could have very well been me !
despite now performing maintenance overseas , as dustin hoffman said in rainman , the only airline not to have had a crash ( jet aircraft that is )
and i have two clients who work for qantas , one a 747 long haul pilot , the other a aircraft engineer .
Let me open with a brief reminder ( or history lesson ) of one of the reasons I first started watching this show :
Now that was funny .
Craig Killborn was funny ...
" The Daily Show " back then had ' ass - kicking ' interviews ...
Oh , yeah , and " Five Questions " ( a wholy owned subsidiary of Craig Industries ... )
Now we have a sitting Vice - President appearing on this show ...
Granted , a new host ( and granted the second clip was n't from the original " Daily Show " ) but this is a news show ?
I 'd put in the Biden clip , only ' twas n't to be found on the intar - tubes ... How droll ...
Anyhow , when did the " Daily Show " become such an institution of news that sitting heads of state would appear on such a thing ?
I guess it got gravity when lots of young kids starting watching .
But you have to realize , Obama went on Leno , Bill Clinton and Madeline Albright have been on the Daily Show , and every Democratic candidate for governor went on the Colbert Report .
The daily show is fun and very successful .
Puts paid to the whole O Reilly Fox crap that no one watches liberals .
Jon Stewart has a great job ... he can give absolute free range to his opinions without any restrictions that the regular news show have .
It 's no more a news show than O'Riley , Beck , Olberman etc.
it 's a comedy show that has some commentary , Stewart would be the last one to say it 's news .
If anyone is using this a real source of news , they need to get out more .
But still , he makes me laugh and most of the time I think he has good points to be considered .
I know this clip is older , but I think he hits the nail on the head regarding most of the commentary shows .
it 's supposedly news satire , though amusingly it 's almost just as informative if not more than the actual news shows running these days .
Obviously Stewart has some political message of his own thrown in .
Similar shows appear in other countries as people get sick of how every news talk show end up being either a pure propaganda 's machine for one particular side or a bickering debate that does n't make sense to anyone .
Taiwan has a version , though it uses actors to cast as famous figures ( started mostly with political figures , but eventually ended up with pretty much all sorts of famous figures ) and they pretend to debate on a serious topic .
Thursday there will be a vote on Net Neutrality ...
How do you feel about the FCC getting their hands on the internet ?
Personally I have enjoyed the only place for actual Free Speech ...
do you want your internet censored ?
Over my dead body !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!! 1
Keep government away from the internet .
Just read the actual law and the analysis .
This law is n't what it seems to be .
Are they ever ?
The first rule of lawmaking is give the bill a name that is exactly the opposite of what it really does .
An emerging issue , how concerned are you over drug violence in Mexico ?
What potential do you see for drug violence to spill over more into the United States ?
Do you believe it to be enough of a threat that necessitates the US to take more action to do something about it , and if so , what action should that be ? ( e.g. border fence / wall , training for the Mexican police / military , monetary aid to the Mexican government , etc. )
This poll is intended for Americans .
The drug violence in Mexico started when the Mexican president decided to " get tough " on the drug cartels .
Guess what ?
They fought back .
Just like the futile war on drugs in the US , the drug war in Mexico will have no greater success .
Fighting a war you ca n't win is not noble .
It 's stupid .
Stop fighting the war on drugs and the violence will go down .
We need to get the government out of the prohibition game once and for all .
Legalize it , regulate it , and control it ( and tax it , too ! ) .
These drug killings are no different than Al Capone killing people during alcohol prohibition .
Once drug dealing ( AKA beer , wine , and liquor sales ) became legal and regulated , murders in America dropped dramatically .
Plus we stopped locking people up because they wanted to get drunk .
There 's more about this on my Cop in the Hood blog .
Recently i learned about Obama 's service plan , yeah may be late but better than never , and this is bothering me .
According to his website and other sources I understand Obama 's might mandate 100 Hours of Service per year when in College in exchange to $ 4000 of tuition credit .
To add this his Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel has confirmed on 10th Nov to draft a plan in this regard .
Further the following is a quote form Emmanuel 's Book , The Plan : Big Ideas for America ,
If they are just to be " asked " , then it sounds like a great deal .
Though if it were , I see zero reason to limit it to college students age 18 - 25. If it 's required it 's nothing more than a civil service draft , slavery .
Might as well be forcing ' em to work the cotton ...
Either way , good luck getting a bunch of drunk / stoned college kids to add that workload to their college and job workloads .
as long as their just asking
IMO its a fair price to pay .
This coming from someone that footed their own college tuition , No mommy and daddy allowences , no grants or anything else .
And it will keep them out of trouble and teach them some things as well .
IMO a good call and for some perhaps a way to look at things in a much better perspective .
Awesome , $ 40 / hr , that 's more than what I make .
Lets ' see ... 100 hours of service for $ 4000 credit .
So for a trillion $ bailout , someone owes 25 billion hours ?
thats if they do not mandate ... but if mandate ... that 's communism ... that the first step ....
I think it is an excellent idea , people should be made aware of what to do in a crisis .
Far to many people around the world today always expect someone to be there when a disaster strikes , especially natural disasters .
Here in New Zealand everyone is taught how to cope and survive for up to at least three days without assistance from outside .
I realize he is not in office yet ...
Day 1 .
Russia to move missiles to Baltic .
He 's already being tested .
I 'm sure the Russians want to gauge his reaction .
I can not help but recall the age old expression that Youth and Enthusiasim is no match against Wisdom and Treachery .
Obama got some clout as being the President Elect of the US but I shudder when he goes up against Putin .
Was there a specific strike that stood out ?
What was Saddam doing 2001-2003 ?
Obama will have to do something over the top like the four previous Presidents before him did .
This savagery seems to be a requirement to prove one has the mettle to be " tough . "
Nevermind that really being tough is working out a solution that does n't require bloodshed .
Negotiating an end to UN sanctions with the French , Germans and Russians .
As far Obama is concern , I would rather wait for his cabinet appointees ...
To make bold predictions on what Obama will do as president or what he will fail to do as president , one must wait to see who are the all the players .
Would GWB have invaded Iraq if it was not for the Gang of Three ( Wolfwitz , Rumsfeld and Cheney ) ? ..
probably not , and probably George Tennent would have still be running the war in Afghanistan as least had some influence there .
never mine , but a classic example of how " power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely "
Then , you are consistent with your views , and there is merit in that .
Perhapes , others from the other side of the aisle are only seeking consistency , as well .
I gave you an explanation as to why he did what he did ( in part thanks to us ) .
As an anti - war person , of course what he did was horrible .
I would put it akin to napalm or cluster bombs .
The innocents are murdered in a savage manner .
Why does the United States need 12 aircraft carriers ?
We do n't .
That 's why we only have 11 .
Smart - arse .
Why does the US have 11 carriers .
Because 10 is not enough ?
How else can you muscle in on someone else 's turf ?
Park a few carriers off the coast and make sure the despot does n't stray too far from the " American interest " angle .
You forgot we also have 12 amphib carriers .
Each one is as capable as any other carrier in the world . )
So it is in the papers today that the Bush family and the Obama family have met up at the White House for a get together .
How does that go I want to know ?
Does George walk around and whisper things to Barack like " See that security guard there ? Thats Ted .
DO NOT make him mad ! ! " ,
" Careful this floor board squeaks ... cant sneak in late down this hallway "
or " Theres a secret to get this door locked , see you have to push on the door while pulling upward . "
Do the Bushs show them around ?
Are they just given a map and let loose ?
Can they decorate HOWEVER they want ?
Lets say Barack wants teal shag carpeting in the oval office .... can he do that ?
Could Michelle have the hallways painted neon orange if she wanted ?
Do the kids get to pick their own rooms ?
Will they have to share a bathroom ?
Will they have to use a computer in the main living area so they are not accessing naughty things on the internet ?
Is the internet there blocked ?
Could the Obamas even access porn on the internet if they wanted ?
Can the secret service hear things from the outside of the doors they are guarding ?
What if the Obamas just have a personality conflict with a maid or something ?
Can they just fire them at will and have a new one sent over ?
Could they keep a pet giraffe on the grounds if they wanted to ?
If they wanted to get rid of the bowling alley and put in a discoteque could they do it ?
Do they have to put a " Do Not Disturb " sign on their bedroom door , or can they just lock it when they want some undisturbed time ?
And does the secret service knock and wait for an answer or just go charging into the bedrooms / bathrooms .
I wonder if they have ever " walked in " on a president .
There is this really nice site on the White House
Very detailed info and pictures of most of the important rooms , spanning several eras .
I think this shows that pretty much every President can do any design thing they want with both the Residence and the Office Wings
Good questions .
I too would love to know the answers .
I hope someone can help !
As per Anderson 360 , the Incoming First Family get $ 100,000 to do any changes to their living quarters of about 16 room .
Also , any change that they can do is after consultation with historians , since ostensibly any change they would do would become a part of the nation 's history
That does not seem much , especially after considering the extensive changes some previous presidents did .
Not that I am complaining ; thats my tax dollars that 's funding those lavender curtains
Looks like the National REview has already started hedging its bets for a possible defeat .
I am surprised at this .
Surely this is not the time to write down your won candidate
Also , I do n't agree with the tone of the article that McCain 's principled positions are costing his this election .
Do you think far right parties like the BNP in the UK should be accepted as representing a decent part of society or should they be viewed as hate filled bigots ?
Many working class English feel that the UK is no longer Great Britain due to too many immigrants .
Is it racist to think this if you live in an area with more ethnics then Brits like inner city London ?
What do others think ?
Do far right parties deserve more respect or will they always be seen as bigots .
Yes it is .
In order to afford to stay in inner city LONDON , a person , probably along with his family , has to have a monthly income that supports this .
In order to do that a ethnic , has to have a stable job and thus already proving himself worthy . / rant over .
Generally speaking the working - class in a nation have negative views of immigrants because they 're at the economic margins and view immigrants as competition for scarce opportunities .
I do n't see anything wrong with the long - term concerns on immigration that many in the UK may hold , but reform can be carried out through the mainstream parties in Britain without having to resort to a racist / fascist party .
If you 're concerned about immigration from the EU , then withdraw from the EU .
It 's a racist / fascist party .
It may have moderated its tune , but that 's what it is at its core .
Failed coup has led to this trial with Sir Mark Thatcher , Spanish and South African government 's fingered .
Going to be lots of fun on this one .
According to Mannn the bosses were Calil and an ex - British member of the cabinet .
Guys this one is going to cause beeeg problems for a few of the fatcats .
Not many Arms dealers pay for helicopters for the " poor of Africa "
was it guilty conscience ?
Will we ever find out the whole truth ?
I doubt it very much
I do remember Maggie flying out and pulling every string she could to get him this . Considering Du Toit got 32 years and Mann wo n't see much less she saved his life .
thank god for the French
we have all seen the stereotypes the Frenchman defeated by germans in war ungrateful to the heroic american who had their back in WW 2 or the snobby french people whole ignore tourists who speak english
BUT france is the western contradiction of the easts prejudiced views
france maybe a white European ex - colonial western democracy but by no means are they right behind america or britain
when it comes to doing of thinking time and time again france has should the world
not all western nations is the follower of america as its is widely perceived
and i dont think the french will be demanding that the chinese govt suppress the demonstrations we have heard of in china
after all the chinese people are doing what tibetan monks and exiles were fighting for to do in tibet - freedom to protest
( though i must say the attacks on han chinese people has taken a bit of credibility from the tibetan monks )
You know there is one job I DO N'T want this summer and that is the HCIC Security of the Olympics .
Rumour is now that Western visitors are planning to protest during the Olympics and considering the reaction today , we can expect a hell of a lot of kung fu .
That would be extremely distracting when you 're on the look out for car bombs and AK - 47s .
Did the Chinese police state let western media see what was actually happening unlike in Tibet ?
When rallies happen in communist states they are rarely not state supported activities
yay for the French ... at least one western democracy opposes communist police states still .
The Chinese were mostly only buying unlicensed copyright infringed copies of name brand french goods anyway .
If they stopped buying American DVDs it would only mean LICENSED ones .
GO on EbaY they even sell the knock offs to us .
The uhygurs are mostly moslem and an ethnic minority in western china with no self determination ruled by a communist police state .
because some have joined extremist groups does not de - legitmize the plight of an entire people .
i do n't under stand the problem people have with what was said by jack Cafferty .
in the US we have thought communist regimes were thugs and goons since Stalin in the 50s right ?
I think those ok with the chinese police state are really ok with the $ to be made there and they were never concerned about freedom only the spread of market capitalism .
The Chinese were brilliant in adopting large scale no regulation market capitalism thereby co - opting so many Americans who place capitalism and profit motive above a belief in democracy and freedom .
We really need to get out of bed with tyranny if we support freedom in the US
Or rather they do n't know how to use it .
The individual Tibetan has far more clout than the average Han .
The number of posters here touting how good the Tibetans have it is testament to that .
The problem is that the majority of Tibetans are nowhere near the centres where that clout could benefit them .
They are in their little village .
Yes , you may get 1st seat at Beijing University with far lower grades ...
but you still have to study and go to Beijing 1st .
If you 're stuck in your village , you 're SOL .
The other major problem is that because that very few Chinese citizens who are knowledgeable enough to challenge the municipal governments are nowhere near the Tibetans .
Even if the Tibetans want to sue , they do n't know how and that opens up to corruption and abuse since they know the Tibetans wo n't take them to court over it .
I will be attending a meeting with the Veterans Day Parade committee .
We have a Parade on or about Veterans Day in November down Atlantic Avenue in North Long Beach .
We have been doing this for several years now and have had many varied entrants including Mexican prancer horses , re - enactors in various uniforms ( including WW I and WW II German ) , Cavalry units of various countries ( the WW II German cavalry " man " was actually a pretty girl using the helmet to hide her hair ) .
We had a problem last year in that a Gay Pride group wanted to be part of our parade but we kept them out with the excuse that they only suddenly showed up and did not apply to be a unit .
This year we are being " asked " to include an Anti - War unit in the parade made up mostly of people protesting the war in Iraq .
Any ideas on this ?
Besides the initial mistrust of " not believeing " they will not disrupt the parade , unless they are willing to sign a document stating they will honour the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice , and give thanks to the ones who are currently fighting to ensure they " can have an opinion " and not in anyway disrupt the parade .... then I would say no they can not join the parade .......
If they will sign said socument then welcome to the parade .
I would guess both groups want to politicise the event , which is after all to honour veterans , not make a political statement .
If they want a political rally , they can organise their own ,
if they want to participate as veterans then nobody 's stopping them from parading with their units .
If they are n't vets , it 's not their right to parade .
With the troubles in the world economy , and the pound rapidly losing value against the euro , is it time for the UK to adopt the euro ?
What are the advantages of Britain adopting the euro , and what are the disadvantages ?
Have the advantages or disadvantages changed with the current financial crisis ?
It 'll cost a lot to do it which would not be advisable at the current time with the economic situation not looking rosy ,
besides the people here would not stand for such a move .
So even if it made sense it would be political suicide to try and do it .
I just ca n't imagine sitting in a restraunt and ordering a human steak !
I 'm not even sure this url thing is gonna work but it 's a story about scientists growing meat in a vat ( stem cell research ) .
From Yahoo science news friday 11/20/09 .
What do you think about this article / if the url works ... Let me know .
Vat grown meat instead of factory farmed chicken / pork / beef ?
No more E. coli , mad cow , anthrax or foot and mouth to worry about .
Seems like a good idea to me .
Whats not to like ?
Friend of mine in Peru has a whole cookbook full of recipes for long pig .
Hell , I 'd try anything once , but if I change my mind , bet Andrew Zimmer would be right there with a fork and a knife !
On this the 70th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor , we remember all those that are still entombed there and their shipmates !
We are here because they are there !
It seems as each year goes by , more and more lessons of history are forgotten !
Our fearless leader 's children 's private school is observing the day by serving Japanese food for lunch !
The Japanese are observing this day as well by telling everyone that it never happened or we made them attack us because we would n't give them things .
If you ever get the chance to to watch the documentary about Nanking and the other Japanese atrocities during WWII you will be shocked to find a picture taken of a Japanese private bayoneting a civilian and the interview with that very private saying he did n't do it as do many of the Japanese soldiers who did things like this .
Sorry , no love lost for the Japanese .
The Carrier JFK CV 67 was due to arrive yesterday however she was held off an additional day due to high winds in the area and will arrive today at the Inactive Ships Reserve at the former PNSY where she will reside for the next two years in mothballs .
41 Years of service to the USN .
Now it is only a matter of time before Kitty retires and brings to an end the era of steam powered CV 's in the USN .
They need to sell her for scrap and get rid of that floating wreck .
Why waste money maintaining a ship that was in such bad shape , she could n't conduct air ops before they decommissioned her ?
curious in part about how so many of the carriers got to be in . " poor material condition "
I 'm just confused about the posibility of this happening can someone explain it to me ?
Secondly wow has scrapping and breaking gotten to be so expensive that its considered better / more cost effective to do a sink - ex wierd .
Thats a massive amount of proccessed metal .
As more and more ships are built , the scrappers have more and more ships to scrap .
Simply put , the scrappers are falling behind .
Shipyards appear as manufacturing plants ,
scrappers appears as junk yards .
Plus there is glory in building wonderful ships , there is no glory tearing the ships apart .
Special occasions such as keel laying , ship christening , and commissioning ceremonies deal with shipbuilding , no ceremonies for scrapping .
When you go to a store to buy a new shiny mop bucket , you feel happy to do so .
You feel lucky when you receive a new shiny roll of pennies from the bank , you frown when its the old rusty roll of pennies .
When you discard the rusty old mop bucket , you do n't feel sorry to do so . Its people oriented too .
Since carriers costs so much , they are kept in service longer .
Many are of the age of old monochrome television sets , or in the early days of color television sets , you know the ones without remote control .
You would n't think of buying a television without remote control today .
They are so old , they do n't make them any more .
With the carriers , they received their mid - life refits upgrading their electronics and electrical motors .
They have also received their service life extension programs too , upgrading or replacing their larger machinery components .
How many of us still have a 1960s vintage refrigerator , washer and dryers , dishwashers , televisions , automobiles , hot water tanks , ranges and ovens , etc.
US offers warships to India for first time
Interesting in that the USN is planning to prematurely decommission its MHC 51 Osprey class mine - hunting ships .
As regards amphibious ships the USN wants desperately to decommission its steam - powered LHA 1 Tarawa class ( LHA 3 Belleau Wood will actually be decommissioned this fall ) .
These ships will soon start turning thirty years old with no SLEP being undertaken .
It is also said they have aged much quicker than anticipated .
The USN poured a ton of money into the LPD 4 Austin class ships to keep them going for 40 years ( in some cases it will be 40 plus ) w / o a SLEP .
They dont want to repeat the experience .
Eventually thsi may leave only eight LHD 1 Wasp class ships until and IF LHA ( R ) class ships get built .
Also the LPD 17 San Antonio class will be trucated at eight ships IMHO ( some say seven others nine and nine have already been named ) .
This would also open up the possibility of prematurely decommissioning ships as many as four LSD 41 Whidbey Island class ships now turning 20 years old .
Selling two LHA 1 class ( Plus granting two others as spares hulks ) and four LSD 41 class ships to India is intriguing IMHO .
This would give India a ready - made credible amphibious force for very little cost .
With the demise of the Battleships almost a certainty and only a handful , if any , of the DDX class ships to be built ( Plus the truncated LPD program ) the USN is poised to cut its amphibious forces by 1/3 .
The USN is also attempting to fast - track its Seabasing platforms which theoretically would make - up for the draw - down in legacy amphibious warfare platforms .
More on that sometime in the future .
Just my analysis of the situation based on what is available from open sources .
it is a good start because it adds a whole dimension to the INdian armed forces ....
can land forces through these transports anywhere in the indian ocean ...
yeah , but i dont think it make that much of a difference ... since we already have plenty of large landing ships ... which we can manufacture indiginously if necessary .
The landing ship is something we can do without .
It is a very old decrepit ship that needs a huge major overhaul to bring it up to today 's standards .
IN would be better off buying a new ship with that kind of money .
INDIA IS BUYING ship TRENTON ( LPD - 14 ) .
NOT BECAUSE OF ITS WAR MAKING CAPABILITY .
BUT TO MOVE HUMANETARIAN AIDS IN ASIAN REGION LIKE IN CASE OF TSUNAMI .
INDIAN NAVY DO NOT HAVE BIG TRANSPORT SHIP LIKE TRENTON WHICH CAN LAND MATERIAL ON SEA BEACHES ETC.
IT ONLY HAS MAGARS CLASS LANDING SHIPS . SO IF INDIAN NAVY GET THIS SHIP , THEN I THINK IT IS OK .
AT LEAST IT WILL GET A CHEAP SHIP FOR DOING MOSTLY HUMANETERIAN WORK .
WAR MAKING WILL BE SECONDARY WORK FOR THIS SHIP .
AND THIS IS THE ONLY REASON THAT AMERICANS HAVE SUDDENLY AGREED TO SUPPLY INDIA THIS PARTICULAR SHIP .
REGARDING AGIS RADARS .
IT IS A SEPERATE ITEM .
WHY ARE YOU DISCUSSING IT ON THIS THREAD .
FIRST LET US BUY THIS SHIP , THEN WE CAN DISCUSS OTHERS .
This is what happens when you take shipboard safety for granted .
Tanks are always dangerous .
Ive been in many and hated every second of it .
I got derided and laughed at alot for the seemingly overcaustiousness I ALWAYS undertook .
People die if you dont .
I preferred not to die thisway . :
Tanks are very dangerous places .
We were always taught in First Aid / Rescue never to enter a tank if there was someone unconsious inside ...
cause you would be next .
Unnecessary tragedy .
I read a story relating to the cleaner Trychlrothylene used to clean a tank in the RN back inthe 70s , the guy was around it too long that his mylenin ( the fatty cover around the spine ) was eaten away by it and he went bonkers for a few hours and then died .
Hell you have to take alot of caution when you are working in closed areas with noxious fumes , even building models you can get messed up off the paints if you dont have an open window .
Yanks out , bombers in , 12 bombs , dozens killed , control battle starts , sunnis v shites , millions of dollars / pounds spent , lives lost , FOR WHAT , for sweet fuck all that 's what ,
Iraqi forces have no chance of controlling ,
Iraq is gonna get worse now than before the west tried to make it better
The innocents are gonna suffer just like before .
lets get out of AG as well leave the village tribal idiots to it .
If push comes to shove , slash n burn , waste no more lives n cash on useless campaign 's . IMO
Does this surprise anyone ? Excluding our glorious leaders of course
IMO , The Iraqi 's screwed themselves by giving into the Sadrists and others .
As mentioned before the US should have punched his ticket and his army of idots before departing Iraq .
Once again politics interviened and spared their sorry ass .
This is what they get in return for that stupid decision .
The large " gray area " knows no boundries . And once you let religion into politics instead of keeping them seperate the black and white disappears depending upon who you are and only gray exists .
A very dismal commentary .
There is no doubt that repeated deployment in the combat zone does wear out individuals . It does lead to whole lot of man management and domestic problems .
And it does create innumerable problems for the govt which has to maintain its aim and deliver .
A catch 22 situation .
That the troops are still managing speaks very highly of their dedication and patriotism and they should be commended .
To overcome this problem , one way could be draft .
But that would be a political suicide .
Also , a draft will not guarantee that the soldiers would be better .
In fact , many misfits would be in , leading to greater problems as was seen in Vietnam .
One of the solution is to have a volunteer force of all nationalities like the French Foreign Legion ( being discussed elsewhere in the Forum ) .
All said and done , a difficult situation indeed , but the national aim can not be forsaken !
It 's just one person 's point - of - view , but from what I can tell , there 's LOTS of fight left in these guys .
I 'm around CENTCOM 's warriors all day every day , and I can tell you that they do n't seem tired and worn out to ME .
One stat I keep seeing thrown around is the approval / disapproval rating of how the war is being conducted .
But if only one third of the troops like the way we 're going about the business of winning in Iraq , that does NOT necessarily mean they 've lost faith in the mission .
Hell , as for myself , I 'm not crazy about how we 're proceeding , either .
But that does n't mean I do n't believe in the mission .
Far from it - I want to go at the job HARDER . I want to WIN .
I want the surge to be BIGGER , SOONER , and to last as long as it takes to WIN .
So , although it 's only my perspective here and backed by absolutely no numbers , stats or facts other than what I know from personal observation , I simply do not see the impending crash coming .
What I can tell you that I do see is a frustrated will to victory , and a sense that our leaders and People are not as committed as we are .
Bluesman , This repeated turnover and its effect I understand to some degree since we ( Indian Army Infantry units ) are always back in the CI grid after every two years .
If we were sent without this break , I am sure we would have got really fed up .
As it is , we have started having problems inspite of this two year layover in peace stations , since the standard of living has gone up and our troops are getting urbanised and soft .
We also have the advantage that we are from the same unit for life in most cases and so the cohesiveness is more and we know each other well .
I believe in the US Army , soldiers can be posted to any unit .
What is the time gap between turn over for Iraq ?
You 'd have to work around them to truly understand what I mean .
Otherwise , I just do n't think you 'd really be able to see it the way I do .
In my job , I work with ALL the inter - agency players , and I NEVER experience the kind of inertia and drag with anybody else .
This is absolutely the truth : the State Department wonks down here do not want to be associated with the word ' kill ' , as in my branch 's mission of ' capture or kill enemy high - value individuals ' .
That 's what we attempt to do ; that 's what they want no part of .
And you 'd have to be here to know what it is to be frustrated and impeded by people that vehemently object to your very existence .
I wish I could express it in a way that you would know what I mean .
( You probably think I 'm just impatient with bureaucracy , which I am , or that it 's a squabble about methods , and there 's certainly those , too .
But it 's MORE than that . )
Then , I think , you would not think it too strident to say they have an antipathy toward an American victory .
bluesman , i have n't worked inter - agency , so i trust you know best .
however , in their defense , i would like to mention that
1. the pinstripers have n't been exactly beloved or respected by the bush administration .
some of this is fair ( state was all but ignored in 2003 ) , some of this is not ( bureaucratic irritation at the initiatives kicking them out of comfortable perches and into WoT hotspots ) .
2. CIA has got plenty of ex - military , and there 's enormous pressure to get more .
i trust that i break no state secrets by telling you that if you head over to langley , you will see a lot of twenty - somethings and lots of fifty - year old senior staff , and not much in between . the lack of a middle is really making ' em push for ex - military to fill that .
i can assure you that patriotism is high up on their values , more so than ever .
I 'll try to explain my perspective on all this .
It might ramble at times .
I was for the war , still am if it could be fought properly , but it ca n't be .
Bush 's goal is a secure Iraq , with a functioning gov't that can police the country and be an American ally in the War On Terror .
THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN .
My knowledge is all second hand , but that 's all I have to go on .
I 'm seeing a picture of a nation of subhuman savages .
Did anyone ever bother to ask WHY Saddam did the things he was hung for ?
We 're seeing the answer to that question .
These people need a dictator who 's willing to use mass murder when they step out of line .
Unfortunately we are n't prepared to use similar tactics , so this war is unwinnable .
If it was up to me , everytime an IED goes off we 'd get our people out , draw a circle on a map with at least a 500m radius around the point of the blast , and turn that area into a smoking crater .
And I do n't care if there 's a school full of kids there with classes in session .
Do that a few times and these " people " might start to behave better .
We can surge troops all we want , but if the level of cruelty does n't increase it will all be pointless .
That 's the only thing they understand .
I ca n't believe I was stupid enough to buy all the tripe about what Iraq could become if we just remove the dictator .
I also have some problems with Bush that I did n't have when I voted for him , based on his piss poor performance .
He 's recently changed policy to go after the Iranian agents that are supplying the militias .
We 've seen stories that the CIA has been tracking these Iranians for over two years .
Why change now ?
WHY DID N'T WE WHACK THEM AS SOON AS THEY WERE IDENTIFIED ???
How many Americans are dead or maimed because Bush was playing some diplomatic footsy game with Iran ?
There are two of our Border Agents in prison for doing their jobs , and twelve Marines sitting in jail in San Diego for hitting the wrong house after they were attacked in Haditha .
Bush has n't lifted a finger to help either of those groups of men , and that 's why IMO Bush has shown himself to be nothing but an honorless pig .
Can someone talk me out of this ?
Because it 's looking pretty damn bleak to me .
IEDs : The Lazy Man 's Insurgency
It 's time to take another look at Iraq , because there 's been a big change in insurgent tactics in 2005 . That 's inevitable . War makes people on both sides think faster . Peacetime armies never learn anything ; wartime armies learn new tricks faster than a hungry raccoon .
The big change is that the insurgents have decided to rely on IEDs rather than ambushes with shoulder - fired weapons to kill the two or three GIs per day they figure they need to wear down the US public 's will to stay in the fight . And it 's working , way too well .
The stats are clear : IED victims make up a bigger chunk of our casualties every month . Over the last six months , IEDs have caused 63 % of US combat deaths . Last month ( October 2005 ) was typical : out of 96 US troops killed , IEDs were responsible for 57 .
Compare that with April 2004 , a terrible month when we lost 140 troops . Back then the insurgents relied on RPGs and small arms . Only 19 of our 140 KIA that month - barely more than a tenth - were killed by IEDs .
The insurgents have decided to do it the easy way . As long as they can use IEDs , their low - tech standoff weapon , why should they risk close combat ?
The real question is why they can get away with it . And here - well , I hate to keep saying this , but somebody needs to . The reason they can do it is because we still have NO INTEL on them . It 's the biggest failure of the war , and nobody talks about it . CI warfare is about people , not hardware . We 're all hardware and no intelligence , like a Tim Allen show . Makes me sick .
That makes the decision to go with IEDs a no - brainer for the insurgents . In the standard ambush , the kind we were facing a year ago , the insurgents detonated an IED under a convoy , then opened up on the stalled survivors with RPG and small arms fire . It probably made them feel good , sort of their version of shock and awe , but the rifle fire was ineffective and by concentrating their forces , the insurgents made themselves vulnerable to our air power .
The problem in any guerrilla battle is the getaway . Anybody can pull a trigger ; the trick is getting your men home safe , while enemy choppers zoom through the sky and every street is full of troops and armor looking for men of military age . That 's the tough part .
An IED ambush has none of those risks . Only one man needs to be on the spot - the triggerman . He detonates the IED from a car parked down a side street and drives away before the occupiers can even start their search . No risk . No casualties . Very demoralizing for the occupiers , especially since they know damn well that everybody in the neighborhood was in on the attack but they ca n't level the locals ' shacks like they 're dying to .
What makes this wave of IEDs worse is that the devices are getting more effective . Frankly I 've been shocked at how good the Iraqis are with these things right from the start . I mean , after that shameful performance in GW I , did you expect these bastards to be so sneaky , patient , and smart ? I knew this war was a bad idea , but even I never realized what we 'd be up against .
The scariest tech development of all is that the insurgents have learned how to make shaped - charged IEDs . To understand why shaped charges are such a powerful weapon , we have to go into the incredibly cool world of explosive physics . I love this stuff . I mean , what red - blooded American boy did n't experiment with explosives ? The only reason I ever opened my Chem book was to see if it mentioned TNT or dynamite in the index . ( It did n't - goddamn hippie teachers . ) And naturally I used the local wildlife , like toads and bees , in my experiments with the killing power of firecrackers .
What I learned was the most important point about the subject : blast alone does n't do a good job of killing the target . A bee would wobble off unhurt after one of my 4th of July daisycutters went off right next to it .
Now before you hotheads whose hobby is making pipe bombs in the garage write me angry letters ( or send me long round packages with no return address ) , I know a blast can kill , if it 's a big enough blast . We had a really nasty example of that in August this year , when a huge IED killed 14 Marines near Haditha . From what I 've read , investigation showed there was nothing special about the IED . It was just three anti - tank mines stacked in a pile - the IHOP of IEDs , I guess you could call it .
That ambush showed real clearly how important intelligence is in guerrilla warfare . The same unit that suffered the IED attack had just had six of its snipers killed in a small - arms ambush . Now you tell me how anybody can ambush six snipers unless they 've completely penetrated the unit . The insurgents knew where the unit 's snipers would assemble , and they knew where the vehicle would be passing . We do n't know a thing about the enemy , but it 's clear that he knows way too much about us .
The other problem is that the 14 Marines were riding in one of those ridiculous landing crafts the Corps uses as APCs - in Haditha , hundreds of clicks from the sea ! It 's called the AAV - 7A1 , and it looks like a giant armored dinghy . Since it was designed to ferry troops ashore , it sacrifices armor and speed and damn near everything else to an amphibious capability that has no use anymore . But that 's the Corps for you . Real brave , but not always real smart .
Maybe if those guys had been in a real APC some would have survived . I ca n't say . If the blast is big enough , it can kill even an MBT . The Pals took out two Israeli Merkavas , the best - armored tanks in the world , with simple blast IEDs .
But most of the time , guerrillas do n't have the delivery systems to depend on blast power . If they 're trying to kill soft targets - i.e. people - they pack the bomb with homemade shrapnel : roofing nails , ball bearings , anything that 'll shred flesh . A suicide vest tipped with nails is basically a 360 - degree 12 gauge .
To kill GIs that way , you need to catch them off - guard , somewhere they feel safe . That 's what happened when a Jihadi killed more than a dozen of our guys in a mess hall in Mosul while they were having lunch -- minus their body armor .
In the field , US troops are a hard kill , especially because they move in armored convoys protected by choppers . And that 's the real beauty of IED attacks for a guerrilla : they absolutely nullify US air power . There are literally no targets for the attack choppers . The pilots know damn well that one of those Iraqi cars driving away from the scene is carrying the guy who set off the IED , but there 's no way to tell which one .
In a strange way , we 're looking at a 3D war . We control the air , but the Iraqis literally control the underground , thanks to these buried IEDs . We fly , they dig .
The insurgents ' first IEDs were simple . Not that there 's anything wrong with simple . The weapons that have been hurting us are all simple , like the RPG . Simplicity is the guerrilla 's friend .
Those early IEDs were usually just shells buried by the road , wired up to a detonator . Lots of amateurs were tinkering in their garages , or whatever Iraqis have instead of garages , playing with stuff that goes boom . And naturally lots of those guys went boom themselves .
Like I said , war teaches people fast , but some of the lessons have to be learned by the next of kin , not the handyman whose bright idea for a new type of bomb turned him into an abstract painting all over his wall .
Sometimes an insurgency has to learn its lessons several times . Take the case of pressure - triggered IEDs . These are basically standard anti - vehicle mines , with something like a bathroom scale as trigger . People and cars can pass over them unharmed , but if a really heavy ( meaning armored ) vehicle rolls over that scale , the bomb goes off . ( Trucks are a problem . Some trucks weigh as much as an APC . ) The best part is that you do n't even need a triggerman to set it off . You can all be off at the hookah parlor polishing up your alibis when it goes off .
The insurgents in Baqouba used pressure bombs in 2003 , but they usually failed to go off . Their bombmakers did n't have the technique yet .
Thanks to info - sharing , the internet gives an insurgency , they 're back at it , with better wiring diagrams . A week ago ( Oct. 24 '05 ) , a pressure bomb shredded a Humvee in Baqouba , tearing four GIs legs to pieces .
The first IEDs were mostly mortar rounds that failed against our armor . So the insurgents went to big 155mm rounds . That 's a big , big shell and when you trigger it at the right moment , it 's going to kill almost anything but an M 1 .
The M 1 is a great tank , so it 's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgents have managed to knock out . As usual , the invasion was the easy part and the occupation was when things got lethal . We only lost 18 M 1s in the conventional fighting , but the guerrillas have since managed to disable 80. Now most of those are track damage , but that 's enough to put a tank out of action .
The good news is that the M 1 has lived up to its rep for crew protection . The Army 's Armor Center says only five crew have died in IED attacks on M 1s . ( Ten other M 1 crew have been killed , mostly by sniper fire , riding in open hatches . )
So if you 're an insurgent bomb - maker , your goal is to find a way to kill M 1s . Not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . And that 's where the shaped - charge IED comes in . Shaped charges were developed for tank killing , used in MBT anti - armor rounds and antitank weapons . Their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal . Metals with low melting points , usually copper . The bomb - maker 's job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible . So sometimes he 'll put several 155mm shells beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of TNT under it .
When the IED detonates , this copper cup turns into a shaft of superheated metal that can zip right through any armor , even an M 1 's . That 's what they tell me , and I have to believe it .
It 's the kind of weird science that used to frustrate me in Physics , the sort of info you just have to take on faith . I ca n't help wondering if they 're kidding us civvies about it all . I do n't get why a soft metal like copper can penetrate Chobham armor , which can defeat almost any warhead around .
Apparently the copper is n't even actually molten . It ejects as a solid ; it just " behaves like molten metal . " I 'm sure the insurgent Home Improvement tinkerers do n't understand the science involved any more than I do . They just hear that it works and try it out .
The US countermeasures have been pretty lame so far . Convoys travel with jammers that make it harder to detonate the IED by cell phone or garage door opener - Nokia and Genie sales are going to drop in the Sunni Triangle . But like I said , low - tech is the guerrilla 's friend . These days they 've gone back to wires , and I hear some are even using string . You ca n't jam a string .
Beyond that , Bush policy is to blame Iran , or Syria , or Satan or whoever .
Iran ? Maybe . Syria ? No way . Syria 's scared to death , ready to do anything to make Uncle Sam happy . And if it is Iran , what can we do about it ? There are still a few neocons so totally out of their little gourds they want us to invade Iran . I have to wonder if they 're agents of Dr Evil , programmed to destroy America . Because invading Iran would do it , it 'd end us once and for all .
This blame stuff is a sign of frustration . Nobody knows how to stop IEDs , even with all the Popular Mechanics geeks sending in their garage - tech brainstorms . That 's because - damn , how many times do I have to repeat it ? - guerrilla war has no technical solution . Or even military solution . The only effective CI techniques are torture , reprisal and , ultimately , genocide .
My guess is that genocide will come back one day . That was how the Ancients dealt with rebellious towns : wiped ' em out . One of these days some first - world country is going to get impatient and a problem child like the Sunni Triangle will be a big , radioactive ghost town .
If we do n't do it , the Kurds may end up doing it the old - fashioned way they learned from the Turks : one bullet , one village at a time . It 's been done before -- seen any Armenians up there lately ? Probably not , but most of " Kurdistan " used to be " Armenia . " A few of the Armenians made it to Fresno , but the rest are buried up there .
We 're talking about Mesopotamia here , the place where war was invented . Hundreds of peoples have been wiped out forever in those parts . All these Holocaust lobbyists get furious if anybody says Jews are n't the only tribe to get genocided , but that 's just politics - " Our genocide is better than your genocide ! "
The fact is , genocide is , historically , the most common result when one tribe runs into another . And something tells me the next big wipeout will happen right there in Central Iraq .
It has a large sky is falling slat but decent read on the IEDs ...
It is true that the IEDs are effective .
It is not a " Lazy Man 's Insurgency " but a " Cunning and Diabolical Man 's Insurgency "
Raj ,
Sorry , as I stated , I did n't have much time , but the wife now has the newborn .
A few superficial criticisms :
1. It 's not CI ( counter - intelligence ) . CI is when you thwart your enemy 's intel operations . Thus , gaining intel on when / where the insurgents are planting IEDs is intel , not counter - intel .
2. Iraqis do n't have garages at their houses . Thus , I would conclude that this guy has never stepped foot in Iraq .
Some meaty criticisms :
1. The Marine 's AAV is as armored as the standard Army APC - the M 113. It sounds as if this pundit is probably a former Army guy . Based on the damage to the single AAV that was involved , unless it were a M - 1 , more armor would n't have helped . That 's how big the IEDs are getting .
2. A single 155mm round does n't do any significant damage to US armored vehicles ( the up - armored HMMWV is n't a true armored vehicle in the sense that it was designed from the ground up with armor in mind - it was modified from a cargo vehicle ) . For example , on the Stryker , a 155mm round will scratch some paint off and flatten tires .
3. War is like a sport . It is interactive and tactics , techniques , and procedures evolve continuously in reaction to your opponent . Back to the sports analogy , if you 're getting killed in a zone defense , you switch to man - to - man , etc. He seems to apply a template that the enemies of the US should be dumb and not react . Underestimating your enemy is a bad and dumb thing to do .
4. He fails to mention the intel that we get that allows us to defuse the majority of IEDs before they are detonated .
5. He fails to mention how switching back to wired devices makes it easier to catch the trigger man .
6. He fails to mention how using larger devices means that you need to spend more time preparing the site , which means a greater chance of compromise .
7. He complains about intel , but then advocates harsh techniques that run contrary to the values of the US and does n't weigh the impact that these techniques would have on gaining intel from the population and / or bringing the population off the fence and to our side . His recommendations would result is less intelligence - gaining some information from a paid triggerman may result in a few short - term successes within a particular cell , but it will alienate the population and result is less intel over the long - run from the population and future cells that would be created down the road due the increased perception of occupation through the harsh techniques he advocates . As an example , Abu Ghraib , which was the direct result of a half - dozen irresponsible individuals that were able to conduct their abuses due to the lacking leadership of their supervisors , had a huge negative impact on our relations with local Iraqis . The trust we had built with many was eroded and our ability to gain trust with others was much more challenging .
Bottomline , he does n't truly analyze the situation from all aspects and uses some faulty assumptions and some facts that are flat out wrong . In the end , you have the action - reaction - counteraction cycle that is producing bigger IEDs that are easier to catch , but more deadly if you do n't catch it . I 'm not stating that it 's not a problem , but this analysis does n't offer much value .
I hope this helps . As far approaches to COIN , I 'm sure that Ray , Lemontree , Dave Angel , and some of the others on this board whose militaries have been doing COIN for much longer than the US ( which , BTW has done COIN quite frequently , but then shuns it as a freak occurance and does n't internalize the lessons learned in favor on focusing on the " big threat " ) can comment at length on why this article espouses the wrong approach to the problem .
I 'm just wondering what Indian posters think your government 's reaction would be if Australia asked for finished nuclear weapons and missiles , plus nuclear know how , with you for under the table shipments of yellowcake for your nuclear weapons program ?
You see , I 'm hoping that one day befor it is too late that Australia will wake up to the fact that we ca n't rely on the US to be willing to lose a city over us by holding true on the ' nuclear umbrella ' , if ever we had a conflict with China .
By shipping you yellowcake from say a secret source on defence land acqured for ' training ' , we could keep it outside the NPT inspection treaty process so you can build bombs with it .
We ould even fly in vetted Indian miners ( with training ) to avoid the secret getting out here . It would benefit us by allowing payments to be made outside our budget approprations process , which is transparent .
Once we have our missiles we can announce that we are joining you in the non - aligned movement , transport weapons grade uranium between us openly and generally ignore all the complaints it would generate and other peoples wars , just like you do now .
Does this work for you ?
It would n't be that hard for Australia to build nukes by yourselves .
Involving outsiders usually increases the amount of headaches you have to deal with .
IMO , Every " first world " - technologically modern nation could probably do it today - some have chosen not to ( like Japan and Germany ) perhaps because of history ?
I think Australia probably could do it if they wanted too , and the rest of the world would n't object as much as they would if one of the historically agressive non - nuclear nations did it .
A lot of the nuclear weapons tech that was unattainabe 20-30 years ago is attaintable now . It would be very expensive , and there would be consequences .
Why should we sell ?
The only reasons we would were if we really needed the money or if the yellowcake were not available elsewhere or if you were the only ones who had something we really needed from an existential perspective as barter .
It could and would probably work if India were to place their own nukes under Indian control onto Australian soil .
For your defense and our own .
Expanding deterrent .
But then you have that option already with the US , so the fact that you ask this question probably points to a drift in confidence or the fact that you feel you would be able to better control an Indian nuke umbrella to your prime advantage versus a US one .
Tired of the ever - hulking , always - advancing glacier of DVD and BD cases in my living room , I 've procured a media server and a Boxee box to run it .
My plan is to migrate all of my media ( probably about 700 DVDs and BDs , counting all the TV shows I have ) onto the server over the next year or so , and banish the hardcopy to a closet for backup .
Media server with 6TB storage running FreeNAS lives in the basement , Boxee box hooked into AV stack ( Plasma , BD player , CD player , cable box , Receiver ) lives upstairs , CAT - 5 network .
So far I 'm getting great quality playback from some items , but real movies that I 've ripped are not great .
I 've played with a few different programs , but I like DVDFab the most so far .
Does anyone know if it 's really a " bit - to - bit clone " , or am I getting some default compression even if I 've set that to 0 % ? - dale
If there 's a visible difference between the DVD and the copy then it 's being compressed .
Sometimes the format you decide to convert it to has issues .
I seldom do it so I 'm not really au fait with what is good but the software I use is Handbrake and convert it to either . mov files or uncompressed mpeg4
Nifty Thread .
I am thinking of implementing a rather lower cost option .
Manually rip all dvds to Mkvs , make a little htpc with a low cost amd llano cpu and a wireless card and hook it up to my TV .
For any gamers out there .. the rumor thread for " Call of Duty 6 " ..
What the game would be like ?
So far its a split between semi - scifi ( Halo ) or literally modernwarfare2 ( COD 4 ) with new maps and missions ..
COD 5 was a disappointment when they decided to go back to the same old world war 2 theme ..
I 'd personally prefer them adding new maps and missions to COD 4 ...
COD 4 to me was the best real - war based FPS ...
maybe more ' politically bold missions ' like Chechnya , Kashmir , Afghanistan , NWFP / Waziristan .. maybe even Cuba / N. Korea ..
Just hope they dont overdo the middle - eastern theme which they pulled off so well in COD 4
If it is " semi - scifi " ( they 're rumored to be looking for a sci - fi title ) ..
I 'm stumped ..
how 'd they possibly pull - off semi scifi without looking like a bad copy of Halo ..
They should do some type of geurilla warfare game set in a wartorn African or South American country .
That could be interesting , like a FPS Contra .
I hope they make the plot as interesting as the last one .
Somilian pirates / mexican drug cartels would bore the hell out of me .
PS : CoD 5 was pretty good .
I do n't know why people hate it so much .
COD 6 - one word - Awesome !!! ...
the trailer looks great .
Plus I got what I wanted - an extension of modern warfare 1 instead of yet another World war 2 scenario .
Looks like they packed a lot more missions into COD 6 compared to COD 4 .
I am so looking forward to October !
This is so much better than last year when I saw the COD 5 trailer ( Flamethrowers and all ) and all I could think of was - " Oh Dear ... "
Since many of our troops are stuck in Iraq , it is likely that we may not have the resources to be able to send troops to Iran .
So there is great likelihood that Israel may act alone .
Although Israel has greater air and ground superiority then Iran , Iran has larger numbers of troops and have long range missles that can reach Israel .
Israel in the past has sucessfully fought off nations with larger numbers of troops before a prime example being the six day war .
So would Israel be able to act alone or would US military intervention still be required to attack Iran ?
Israel would find it hard enough to conduct air raids on Iran , let alone fighting a large scale war .
The distances are simply too great for Israel to be able to project much power against Iran .
I do n't think Israel could act alone .
If they attacked Iran unilaterally , it would probably be a large mission aimed at taking out Iran 's nuclear infrastructure .
They would have a hard go of it .
Iran in retaliation would launch its long range missiles at Israel , as well as encouraging Hezbollah to harass Israel .
I think any Israeli action against Iran would involve bringing the US into the war , I think its the only way Israel can really do enough damage to make the whole effort worthwhile .
I have been searching for sometime now , and I ca n't seem to find a dropshipper that sales merchandise low enough so I could profit from it .
Would someone please help me ?
Hi , Nobody is going to give you their sources .
You are going to have to find them on your own .
There are plenty out there but most of them are more trouble than they are worth .
There are also a very few that are good suppliers but you have to realize , when dropshipping , the profit margin is VERY thin and you have to be on top of them all the time , monitoring their inventory .
People find a dropshipper , sign up and then list , list , and list !
They list soooo much but then when it comes to monitoring the inventory they do not check back into the site to see if the inventory is still available .
You CAN have a successful business with dropshippers but it is W * O * R * K.
It is not E * A * S * Y.
I found all my sources by surfing the net on my cellphone during commercials , while waiting in line , any spare moment .
Search several different ways , most do not even have the word " dropship " on their site .
Good Luck .
And beware of " membership clubs " such as Doba and the like .
They are not your solution .
Real distributors do not charge you for taking your money .
Still , making any drop shipping work in the DSR - feedback - oriented quick ship ebay world will be a challenge .
Please do a quick search and you will find tons of info on drop shipping ... here is a thread from the recent past http://forums.ebay.com/db1/topic/Building-An-Ebay/Using-A-Drop/5200052702?#msg5200760329
which is only of about 25 + since the beginning of the year .
I am sorry but until eBay pins the drop shipping topic all you can do is search older posts .
I can not give you the formula for success , but I can give you the formula for failure -- which is : Try to please everybody . Herbert Bayard Swope
My partners and I refuse to use dropshipping .
If a dropshipper has 100 items for example and we sell 107 to 107 different people then we have 7 potential unhappy customers with the potential for 7 negative feedbacks .
A dropshipper is only concerned with selling their 100 items as fast as they can .
I am concerned with selling the 100 items that are in our inventory as best and correctly as possible .
This is just my opinion .....
OK ... I know the answer to that but it still really bothers me .
This is what was waiting for me when I logged into facebook this afternoon
NO ! eBay should issue a coupon for buyers to use on our listings and get 15 % off ....
we would still get our full $ $ and eBay can give the seller the difference that the buyer saves !
Just really bugs me
Because that is additional revenue outside of seller .
Seller are captive revenue that will be about the same no matter what they do ,
Until someone else come along and challenge ebay they will keep on doing the same thing , but soon or later that will happen , , , ......... I hope sooner
, ... , Most people do n't realize that the best answer are the one that they do n't want to hear . chan
yup .. I knew the answer but still hate it !
Sorry , long story .
First off a little info ..
Marshall amplification has been one of the leading guitar amplifier companies for 50 years .
Many of the older amps are being restored and also there are countless companies offering clones and cloned replacement parts for DIY'ers .
Since I like wood working I thought some folks would enjoy an amplifier shell that they could finish themselves and either use it to restore an old Marshall amplifier or to collect aftermarket parts from countless other vendors and end up with a Vintage Marshall clone .
So , I have had pretty good luck selling these wooden amp head shells in the past and thought I would reintroduce my product .
Well , Ebay pulled my listing for having the word " Marshall " in the title .
My actual listing read " Marshall style plexi / JCM 800 headshell for project . "
Notice the word " style " .
I did a quick ebay search using " Marshall style " and came up with 100 's of listings that use that term for after market parts and kits .
The listings I clicked on were NOT actaul Marshall products .
I also searched another famous amplifier company and typed in " Fender style " .
Again 100 's of listings for aftermarket parts and kits .
Why was I singled out when there are 1,000 's and 1,000 's of people listing this way ?
And its clear that I did not claim it was an actual " Marshall " product which is why I put the word " style " in the listing .
Does not seem right .
People who are looking for these items wo n't find them without knowing that it is for a Marshall or Marshall style amp .
I love the smell of packaging tape in the morning .
Ca n't use the manufacturer 's name in the title unless the item being listed is actually made by the manufacturer .
eBay rules - not mine .
Michael 's right - someone somewhere decided to report you , and you ended up getting a wrist - slap .
You - could - start reporting all the " style " listings you found and ( hopefully ) watch them go away .
Sometimes it only takes one report ... sometimes you gotta stay on top of it for a while .
There are special rules for what you want to do , offering non - brand replacement components ( in your case , the wood case ) .
Unfortunately , I just do n't recall what they all are ...
there 's a way to word the description that works and does n't get you slapped for " keyword spamming " ( which is what putting Marshall in the descriptive text will earn you ) .
Fun stuff , eh ?
That sounds right ...

Hello ,
I wonder if someone can clear something up for me ?
I have a GBP 63,950 SVR mortgage with Halifax with 19 1/2 years left . ( it 's currently GBP 64,570 due to some stupidity a few yrs ago ) .
Now , this was originally taken out as interest only but when I 've phoned a couple of years ago to increase the payment they have changed it to " part interest , part repayment " . Not too fussed about this as I 've worked out the numbers and the correct amount is coming off the capital every month .
I 'm going to contact Halifax for details on how to make overpayments as I 've increased my direct debit again but would like to be able to make ad - hoc overpayments when I 'm able to .
Thing I 'm curious about is the 10 % overpayment thing - I know my mortgage agreement is subject to this however what does it really mean ? Should I only be paying 10 % more than my interest only payments or is it 10 % extra off the capital ? My new direct debit ( as of end Dec 12 would take me over the 10 % of IO payments ) .
I 'm guessing they will give me a rough idea of how much I can overpay in GBP s based on my current direct debit but would be interested to know beforehand just for my knowledge .
Currently Halifax have on their records that " Pensions " will be paying the capital off at the end of the term - these are currently non existent so trying to get myself at least on track for repayment at the end of term .
Thanks very much !
its 10 % of the mortgage balance for the year , so if your mortgage balance in GBP 100,000 that year you can overpay by GBP 10,000 during the course of the year without penalty .
However , if you are on the SVR you dont have the 10 % limit , just overpay as much as you can comfortably afford
Quote :
Are you sure you 're on SVR ? Or just a rate that is soon to end ?
Having worked for Halifax it is indeed correct that once you 've reached the SVR then no overpayment limits are enforced you are simply free to overpay as much as you wish to .
This is correct . Your KFI / Mortgage Offer may say something along the lines of ' in any one year you may repay up to 10 % of the amount outstanding on your special rate product ' . It 's a rolling 12 months , so the year starts when you make your 1st overpayment . So , you could n't pay GBP 10k in december and another GBP 10k in january for instance , you 'd need to wait 12 months .
Then , once your ' special rate product ' ends , you go onto SVR , with no overpayment restrictions .
Hi , I 'm in the middle of a divorce and am trying to take on the mortgage on the family home .
I 'm only trying to borrow about 16 % of my home 's current market value , which is about twice my annual income .
Have approached several big lenders and tried going through a financial adviser , but noone will lend because my income is made up of : 4 very part - time jobs ( 2 employed , 2 self - employed ) , maintenance ( not yet Court ordered ) and tax credits .
Their argument is that once my daughter leaves school some of these income sources will cease , but by then I would hope to be back at work full time ( she 's only 7 ! ) .
The mortgage rates I 've been quoted are less than I 'm paying at the moment anyway !
It 's been suggested to me that I try and take out a personal loan instead ?
Anyone got any suggestions ?
You would think that having 4 part time jobs that at least you will have 2 at any one time and that is more secure than having 1 full time job and possibly being given notice to leave .
It sounds like you are self employed and will need the assistance of an accountant to create some books that show some decent profit combining all the sources of income streams as one source of income .
They may be doing an affordability calculation instead of a income multiple and do n't think you can afford to pay for day to day living expenses and a mortgage .
I would get another financial advisor who can help you .
Someone should be able to lend you the money .
Hi all , I currently have a mortgage which what used to be Northern Rock .
I took the mortgage out in 2007 , fixed rate for 5 years .
This is due to finish in June .
I do n't know what to do !
I took the mortgage out with my then husband , we split two years ago .
He did all the money side of things so have no idea where to go .
I have a funny feeling that since house prices have dropped , I am likely to be in negative equity .
We borrowed more than 100 % , retrospectively a stupid thing to do .
I have taken the mortgage on on my own .
Any advice would be gratefully received , thank you .
In rate terms , there 's nothing you can do .
If you are in negative equity as you seem to think , there is no prospect of another lender taking you on , so a remortgage is n't going to be possible .
NRAM / UKAR which is the body managing your mortgage does not offer replacement or customer retention products , so your mortgage will revert to the follow - on rate set out in your original Key Facts Illustration ( KFI ) or mortgage offer .
This is likely to be the standard variable rate , currently 4.79 % .
Given theat the current lending and borrowing siatuion , it is more difficult for people to get a Mortgage .
I understand that Martgage broker is to be able to see from a lot of providers .
But for people are dififcult to get mortgage today , is their advise is worthy ...
Say for instance they say it is better you ask for this provider but in fact , when you afollow their suggestion , you get rejected ?
Is not that it is better to sticj to your bak who knows wel your financial stability and ability ??
I undesratnd that some mortgage adviser are free of charge .
I am asking here because once you get rejected it will seriously danage your credibility to get another lender ?
Opinions and expereince from people in ths forum are really appreciated ....
First of all I disagree that its harder to get a mortgage ... compared to the days of 100 % + mortgages yes but for the right applicants there is plenty of lending available .
Obviously I am biased as I am an independant mortgage adviser but my view is it is good that we can source the whole market finding the best deals and knowing the specific lending criteria of each lender .
I used to work for a bank and I would never offer my services to my friends and family as I did n't know whether there were better services elsewhere .
Now I am comfortable doing things for my friends and family .
Banks will want you to think that you have a better chance of getting a mortgage with them as you have your finances with them but this is simply not true .
If you get rejected you need to look into the reasons why ... affordability .. credit score etc
Hi My husband and I are looking to buy the hosue we currently live in , but we do not have a deposit .
Are there any 100 % mortgages out there and which ones are the best to look at -
I am totally useless when it comes to things like this and hubby is no better !!!
I currently earn about GBP 21k a year and hubby earns just under GBP 15k a year .
What is the likelyhood of us getting a mortgage to start off with and is going to be more difficult to find 100 % one ?
Any advice would be appreciated . Thanks
Whats the value of your house ? ,
hows both your credit rating ?
This seems to be the 2most important factors when considering a mortgage other than your joint income .
The chance of getting a 100 % is probably impossible to be honest ...
A shared ownership property is one where you do not buy the property outright , but only a percentage share of the property . For example only 25 % .
However on the remaining 75 % which is still owned by the housing association , you will pay a monthly rent .
So if you are not looking at this types of properties , you will not get a 100 % mortgage .
Hello all - just joined and after some advice .
I 've seen the posts on the forum relating to the Nationwide consent to let and subsequent hike in interest rates by 1.5 % ( this is going back a year or two ) .
At the time my wife and I were renting out our property and had signed up to a 5 year fixed rate mortgage .
We initially lived in the property but subsequently let it out having received permission to do so from Nationwide .
Given we were in a fixed rate mortgage and had paid for the extra security i was pretty shocked and appalled that they were forcing this increase on us .
In any case my wife went to Nationwide to discuss our options with the mortgage adviser .
The long and short of it is that the mortgage adviser gave the advice that given base rate was 0.5 % and we could move to another lender on a formal BTL mortgage for a far lower rate ( given with the 1.5 % increase our Nationwide rate would be over 7 % ) and therefore over a the mortgage term more than cover the early repayment fee .
This advice made perfect sense so we paid to come out of our fixed rate with Nationwide and moved to another lender - the early repayment fee was circa GBP 3k .
Subsequently we received the letter from Nationwide ( as I am sure many did ) saying that those on fixed rate mortgages that would have to pay early redemption fees would not have the 1.5 % increase imposed until the end of the term of the fixed rate .
Given the advice we received and subsequent redemption fee we paid ( prior to Nationwide changing their minds ) I wonder whether anyone thinks we have any recourse against Nationwide .
Be very interested in any thoughts .
Many thanks
It definitely sounds interesting .
I would certainly go to the branch , speak to someone in management and present this letter along with any documentary evidence that you may have had from your previous meeting .
Also get them to produce the notes of your previous meeting with the mortgage adviser .
we came within a gnats whisker of paying a 7k early redemption fee to avoid the 1.5 % hike .
thankfully the letter arrived a day before our completion date on our new mortgage so we were able to get out of it .
only 15 months until we can leave nationwide and move over to a proper btl mortgage .
Are there any bridging companies who 'll do a loan for an uninhabitable property ( it 's derelict ) ?
We need to borrow 55 % of the hammer price until we can get planning permission for restoration which will allow us to get a mortgage
( verbal approval of our plans has been given by the local planning officer and the building society in question ) .
( Excuse me while I do a little - this is a building we nearly bought through normal channels 5 years ago , got gazumped on and never thought we 'd ever get another crack at it ! )
It does n't seem likely and would be horrendously expensive .
Look at it from the lender 's point of view :
This is high risk - if you do n't get planning approval the site could actually be worth a negative amount ( due to demolition costs ) .
Verbal approval is essentially worth nothing .
On the flip side there is little return for the lender as you do n't want the loan for long so not much time to charge interest .
Really you would be better off : Getting a mortgage not a bridging loan ( also difficult ) . Getting an unsecured loan to buy it initially .
Be aware that almost no bank or building society will give a mortgage on a property after it has been bought , if it was bought less than 6 months ago .
I do n't know the answer to your question , but it sounds very risky to me .
You will be taking on a costly short - term loan based only on verbal promises which may not eventually come good .
What happens if the B Soc does n't eventually make an offer , or it 's at a much lesser amount than you hope for ?
Does it know that the house is uninhabitable - usually that makes a property unmortgeable .
Or if the PP takes much longer to be considered because there are objections / it 's refused and you have to appeal etc ?
Last time we got a thread like this , I suggested Tiuta and the OP did some research and found the cost was prohibitive .
I echo the other comment about how you deal with being unable to remortgage if something goes wrong and would ask you to note you 'll have to stick with the bridging finance for around eight months as you wo n't be able to apply for the remortgage until you 've owned the property for six .
Caution needed .
Bridging is only possible where the lender believes you will live elsewhere .
They can not lend on a property you will be living in as this then falls into FSA regulation , which bridging is excluded from .
An alternate to bridging is a non status mortgage , but the lender will still need to survey the property and carry out the nusual due dilligence to include full legal conveyancing and checks .
The reason most aution deals are cash is that lending is NEVER guaranteed and can fall through at the mast moment , meaning the applicant looses the property and thier 10 % deposit .
You 'll need a good deal of luck to get this through using lending .
Also bridgers usualy want a clearly defined exit route , and it wont be sufficient to say a remortgage should be possible subject to all manner of property repairs ( what if you fall ill / go mad / get depressed part way into the renovation for example ) .
Hi all , current mortgage fixed deal ends in March and this will be the first time remortgaging .
Purchased the property March 2009 .
The property was valued at GBP 102000 when we purchased it and we now owe GBP 77000 .
I am interested in learning more about how valuations work when remortgaging .
Do they come round ?
Are there any ways I can improve the potential result ?
What happens ?
Nothing much has changed since last valuation in or out the property .
To be honest I would be happy with GBP 102000 valuation but guess we will find out .
Any information anyone can provide about this process would be great .
Are you remortgaging to a new lender , or doing a product transfer with the current one ?
If it 's the latter , chances are your current lender will use a desktop system called HomeTrack .
If you are moving your mortgage to a new lender , it will normally ask a surveyor to visit the property to establish its value .
As you are right on the 75 % borderline for the better products , I would imagine an inspection would be better for you .
Talk to your current lender before you start shopping around .
It 's been solved now .
thanks for everyone
Why on earth would you allow somebody else to sort out payslips and P 60 for you ?
If you had proof of income why not provide it ?
You have been complicit in any fraudulent application by allowing it to happen with full knowledge .
Struggling to see how you could compain to the lender and CAB when you applied fraudulently .
I suspect you are now registered as a fraudulent applicant and will struggle to gain finance anywhere .
Hi , I 've a dilema !
Looking to remortgage , and have found suitable product from Yorkshire Building Society . GBP 195 non - refundable application fee , conveyancing and valuation free .
It is a 75 % LTV .
My house is worth VERY close to the 75 % mark .
If I apply , and the valuation comes out lower , I 'd have to pick the next best product , which is actually Santander .
Santander valued for free at GBP 180000 , which is the amount we estimated it to be .
Mortgage balance is GBP 134000 , so as you can see , very close to the 75 % .
I could just go with Santander ,
no fees , but would cost me additional GBP 1700 over the 3 year fixed term .
Do I risk losing the GBP 195 ?
I suppose only I can answer that , but any thoughts or tips ?
You appear to have done the maths and identified the pitfalls .
If there 's no way of avoiding that fee , you appear to have to risk it .
Is n't there a product with no fees you could choose upto 75 % so you 'd lose nothing if the property is downvalued ?
Lenders I have spoken to say that while their valuation fee is ' free ' , you still have to pay for it but it is refunded if you go ahead .
I guess it 's not always the case ( only spoke to 2 lenders , and perhaps I only discussed it with one of them ) .
It 's one of the reasons why I 'm not remortgaging at the moment - found a great 80 % rate but could go the wrong way of the house is valued lower than expected .
Just to also say , YBS are quite strict on affordability too not just LTV ,
their online affordability calculator is quite close .
Santander are not as strict .
Good evening people ,
Was looking for a little advise in regards to the possible mis - selling by a mortgage broker of a 100 % intrest only mortgage .
My partner signed up for a 100 % intrest only mortgage with the Nothern Rock mortgage but to realise it was a intrest only mortgage some 5 years down the line .
The reason I feel that may have a case to be answered is that surely mortgage company must take some precautions when selling an intrest only mortgage
i.e the customer must take out some sort of endowment to ensure that when the mortgage intrest is finally paid off then the customer would be in a financial position to pay of the actual amount the mortgage was agreed for ???
The mortgage broker who advised obviously has a case to answer but are nothern rock in the wrong aswell ?
Any information that can be offered would be greatly appreciated .
No , there is not .
Read the paperwork she got when she took out the mortgage - it will explain that you need to set up a repayment vehicle for the capital amount .
I would also be amazed if the broker did not also advise her of this .
Unfortunately this was quite a common problem , particularly with young first time buyers who have no real clue about mortgages .
This was a problem during the boom years in that banks were not checking if customers had a repayment vehicle in place , hence they were throwing these interest only mortgages at people because that 's all they could afford because house prices were so high .
There are people on here who will deny this ever took place .
Many people put a lot of faith in some of these brokers in the belief that they were acting in their best interests .
Unfortunately there is probably little come back because ultimately your partner should have read closely what she was getting into before she signed .
I know that might sound callous but there is the saying that covers this which is ' buyer beware ' .
Where do we go from here ?
Some stocks have had a great run since early March
is it time to cash in and wait for the next drop or have we bottomed and its a steady rise from here ?
I would like to here from anyone who saw the last recession , late eighties , pan out and how the sectors reacted .
I viewed charts from then ,
it shows volatility till '92 before a general steady rise although different sectors behaved differently
Any thoughts appreciated
Quote : Agree with Purchy .
I think we 'll be rangebound for quite a few years .
Except there is a good chance that commodities and commodity stocks will spike violently upwards for a while in a year or so ( higher than they were in 2008 ) , thanks to supply destruction which may well have a coiled spring effect .
Also inflation and a falling dollar should help them go up as well ..
There is also good reason to believe that commodities will rise over the long terma s well .
Hi , 1st time posting so please bear with me !
I am due to receive approx 20K from sale of deceased parental home and need to find somewhere to put it .
have used up my isa allowance ( so has hubby ) may need to access all our funds within the next 12 month as we will either be moving home or doing self build if nothing suitable comes on market .
therefore need to be able to access funds without too much penalty / notice .
Have 2 kids and wonder if i could put money in children accounts for better tax free interest or do you have any suggestions please ?
Thanks in advance for any help
Based on what you have said , you should not invest but stick to savings .
Check out the usual tables on this site for interest rates .
If you put money into the name of your child it becomes his beneficially .
In any case see http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tdsi/children.htm for tax treatment of interest on money given to children by parents .
You could always hold the cash in an on - line account ( AA paying 3.2 % gross ) until April
then each of you can put GBP 5640 into a cash ISA ?
Hi An elderly relative ( late 80s lives in annex adjoining the house ) has banked with lloyds all her life - and she asked me for some general advice .
I wasnt at all familiar with her financial situation and she has in the past been advised by Lloyds .
What appears to be the case is that she has : GBP 150k + in an OEIC / shares ISA with Scottish Widows GBP 30k in easy access savings account paying 2 % with lloyds GBP 15k in current account with Lloyds GBP 5k in cash ISA with lloyds
What struck me was that she has all her savings in Lloyds / Scottish Widows so well over the GBP 85k protection limit .
Also that she had been advised to put so much in OEIC / corporate bonds / shares ISAs as it appears her capital has been fluctuating ( generally down ) .
She invested this whilst in her 80s so am struggling to see how it would be good advice to ask her to put so much in a scheme where capital is not protected .
Anyhow we have booked an appointment next week to go through this with me in support .
Do others think this advice is strange ?
And what would others advise .
My instinct is to get her into good savings accounts where capital is not at risk and to split it across 3 different institutions ( it seems you can can get 3 % + if you keep an eye on the rates being offered ) , plus make sure she uses all the ISA allowance each year
Any thoughts / commented would be appreciated ? David
I 'd be reluctant to start messing with an elderly relative 's finances .
Others in the family might accuse you of all sorts when she dies .
That said : 1 ) If she 's of sound mind you need to understand if she 's prepared to move from LTSB or not .
Another bank may confuse her significantly .
2 ) If she wants to stay with LTSB , support her in finding the best home for her money from their range , but also help her to keep it in a good paying account , as most of their accounts have 12 month bonuses .
3 ) Make sure you do n't do anything with cash ISA that could impact her stocks and shares ISA .
4 ) Get her agreement to shift money from the current account to a better savings account ( even if it 's only the 2 % one ) .
Just because somebody 's old does n't mean that capital should be protected .
My biggest concern for her would be if she owns a property .
There 's a high chance of an IHT bill on the horizon .
I 'd be talking to an IFA about the best ways to mitigate this .
As dunstonh suggests , the shares will effectively be in her name and are n't relevant to the protection scheme .
This is a very tough one .
Banks generally will do what 's best for them which is invariably bad for the customers .
There is a lot of evidence these are some of the worst routes to market due to them often having the highest costs .
As mentioned though , change is never fun , especially when it could be confusing and misunderstood .
I would personally say she should find an IFA and pay upfront for advice ( ie no commissions ) so she gets what is most suitable for her .
Given her age it 's standard practice to have less money in equity and more in guaranteed income than she currently appears to have due to short term fluctuations .
I 'm probably going to get criticized for what I 'm about to write , but as a long time lurker on these forums I know that I can also expect some sensible and honest opinions .
I have been having a relationship with a married man for some time now and I 'm starting to get fed up with the situation and wonder if this is all it 's ever going to be .
How likely is it that a married man would leave his wife for the ' other woman ' , How do I know if he 's serious about me or just toying with me ?
I know he does love me , but that 's not always enough is it ?
I am really torn at the moment whether to let things carry on , or to walk away .
Likelihood of him leaving his wife for you , slim to none .
Even if he does could you live your life happily ?
If he can do it to his wife , would he have qualms about doing it to his girlfriend ?
1. The person you are having the affair with is cheating on his wife .
If he does it once , he could do it again - remember the old saying " when a man marries his mistress , it leaves a vacancy - for the next mistress " .
2. Quite simply , he is cheating , you are cheating .
There are all the excuses in the world " he will leave when the children are older / when his wife is better / when they 've sorted out finances - just waiting for the right time to tell her " blah , blah blah , blah !
If you have any integrety , you would walk away now .
Are you in a relationship with anybody ? or are you single
He 's having his cake and eating it at the moment ?
Why would he want to give that up ?
I 'm struggling for ideas as to what to do for my birthday this week .
DH will be at work , DS at school and DD at nursery till 12pm unless i choose to take her out for the day so i can go somwhere till 3. 15pm .
In some ways i envy my DH who has a July birthday that generally falls within schools holidays and we are all around him with good weather .
On mine its generally dull , raining or cold and everyone is working .
This year I 've thougth and thought about what I can do either on my own or maybe with my almost 4 year old .
My Mum suggested I go over with her to visit my dad who 's on a house sit and have a sandwich with them at lunchtime and open my pressie .
This seems to be my best option but its not what i would choose to do or really want to do .
My parents have chosen to do this house sit , i really dont mind but i 'm not sure i want to go over , walk the dog and sit in a strangers house for a couple of hours to pass the time .
Any thoughts please on what you grown ups do for January birthdays when the weather is rubbish and your friends are working .
I dont expect to be entertained and happy to potter around or go to a National Trust / Swimming , but my local pool doens't have an open swim on thurs suitable for my availability and i do n't have a car free to drive .
Hmmmm ....... its quandry !
Chalk it up to one those things that happens when you have kids and do something at the weekend instead .
Mine was on the 13th .
( ETA : had I had the money , I would have gone off for a couple of hours and a coffee at the nicest garden centre near to where I live so I could get there by bus )
go for a meal with your DH in the evening after his work , and get your parents to babysit ?
day time wise - how much money do you want to spend ?
Get your nails / hair etc done ?
Depends what youre in to .
i dont normally do anything in the day time for my bday ,
Id do something at the nearest weekend or that night .
I 'm trying to muster some sympathy for you but I 'm sorry I really ca n't .
My birthday is in January too , and most year I have to work . For the whole day !!!!
This year , I worked all day , could n't celebrate with my dd because she was working in the evening , so I went out for a bite to eat with a couple of friends and then on to see a film .
I 'll celebrate my birthday with my dd when we both have some time together ... in February .
Your parents want to see you and spend some time with you , give you a present so be gracious ( and a bit mature ) and go !
hi , i am getting married on february 18th 2012 and i am planning on buying a gift for my wife to be .
She loves tiffany and i bought her the chunky link bracelet with heart in the first few months that we were together so now i am thinking to get her the necklace .
Is the official tiffany Uk website the only place to buy official and not fake items or are there other places that sell tiffany ?
plus anyone else have any other similar ideas ??
looked at links of london and pandora but I 'm not sure ....
Sounds lovely .
The only place to buy genuine Tiffany is the website or Tiffany shops .
The only place to get Tiffany cheaper is the airport shops abroad , if the exchange rate / duty free combination works in your favour .
Having the matching necklace is a lovely idea .
If she likes charms you could get the Links sweetie bracelet - then you have the next few presents sorted out for the charms .
OH came home from work on Monday evening by taxi and found 3 men trying to break into the house .
They set upon him , knocked him to the floor and kicked him several times in head and stomach , stole his mobile phone and bag and ran off .
The police came out very quickly , did a drive around with OH and the cabby but did n't see them that night .
They took DH 's bag ( which they found dumped a few streets away ) and said they would forensically test it , and there was a CCTV camera which covered the area and the cabby said he could definitely identify the men as he got a clear view .
DH has not been asked to give a statement , and we assume nor has the cabby .
He got a letter in the post this morning , dated Tuesday , saying the police were closing their investigation .
The detective in charge has n't answered phone calls and his bag has n't been returned to him , which contained business papers and clothes .
DH did need treatment at A and E after the attack
It seems pretty clear that the police did not bother with forensic testing and may not even have checked the CCTV footage .
Is there anything which can be done to challenge their decision not even to do a preliminary investigation into an attempted burglary and common assault , where there are witnesses to the attack ?
If it is relevant at all , DH has no previous convictions , arrests or anything similar with the police , and is a middle aged businessman set upon by 20 year old males of a different racial background to us .
no , something is wrong here .
They ca n't just ' close an investigation ' the day afterwards , not having even taken statements .
I 'd say get some legal advice , or write to the Police , stating what you 've put in your post above and ask for an explanation .
you could try posting this on the moneysaving in marriage and relationships board ?
you might get more answers there .
I would get down to the police station sooner than just writing a letter .
If CCTV needs to be examined and has not yet been looked at , you want it seized asap , before it is recorded over .
It is of course possible that the CCTV was n't working on the day in question but I am still surprised no other forensic examinations have taken place .
If a full note of your OH 's / the cabby 's evidence was taken in a police notebook then the need for an immediate witness statement is reduced .
If this is really true , start here : http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Pages/default.aspx
BUT ! Be prepared to be stopped for motoring offences by disgruntled coppers for the next 10 or so years ........
Make a formal complaint .
The police are trying to fiddle the figures .
Was it even recorded as a crime ?
Ask for the crime number and see .
I 'm actually V excited as it all seems like fun , but all ex leaders are V cynical ?
I think as with everything from reading this thread there 's always the politics and the ooo could you just do a bit more for us aspect , we 'll have to keep our mouths firmly zipped .
I 'm looking to trying to start volunteering sometime in the near future and was a rainbow / brownie / guide when younger and think i might enjoy helping out but have no idea how to make the first steps to get involved
Hi All I am looking for advice please .
DD 1 is in futher education -
because the course she wanted to do is n't available near us she is in residential college and we pay her accommodation and food costs ,
it leaves things very tight , but as we felt this was a great opportunity for her we were prepared to do it .
She also has the use of a car as its easier ( and a lot cheaper ) than us driving her back and forth most weeks .
DD 2 is due to leave school next summer and is hoping to start a hairdressing apprenticeship .
She started to talk about driving lessons ( a bit premature I know ) and us buying a car and paying for petrol and insurance .
I mentioned to her that as she will be earning an income it will be time for her to start paying us towards her keep , etc.
She thinks that will be very unfair as we are still paying for her older sister .
Any suggestions please - we are prepared to take the money and put it away for her future ( although I would n't admit that to her as she would want it sooner rather than later ) .
I do see her point , but am not prepared to let her get away with not paying anything .
Thanks for reading .
Does her sister earn any money ?
If she does n't , then you could speak to them both about the contributions you expect from them when they both start earning .
As for the car - Did you pay for DD 1s lessons ?
It seems unfair to not pay for DD 2s if you did , and then to allow access to the car .
I do n't see why she would expect her own car if her sister shares yours , although you will have to think about priorities for who needs the car and what you will do if both want the car !
Letting her get away without paying anything wo n't teach her anything for the future , but equally if she does't get the same treatment as her sister she 'll probably feel quite upset .
My grandaughter is in the final year of 3 of a hairdressing course ,
she has to work part - time in a salon but does n't earn very much and the stuff she has had to buy / keep replacing for the course has been very expensive .. so my daughter has had to help her by not actually taking any keep money as long as she is on the course ..
its meant my grandaughter has managed to pay for all her own clothes , fares , lunches , and going out money over the course ..
my daughter was happy that she 'd found something she wanted to do and was able to near enough support herself through it ..
as I said at the beginning as an apprentice she will be earning peanuts ..
I agree with what is being said TW .
To support DD 1 to the tune that you are and then to expect DD 2 to pay into the household on what I 'm sure will be a much less than minimum wage apprenticeship seems like a double blow to DD 2 to me ! and I can appreciate her frustration .
I do think that whilst DD 2 is doing her apprenticeship she should be allowed to retain her wages .
You should explain to her that this is your way of ensuring that they are both treated equally in what are very different circumstances .
However I would also make clear that once either of them begin to earn a full time wage outside of college or apprenticeship that they will be expected to contribute to the house if they continue to live there !
I wish you well .
I 'm sorry but I can see your DD 2 's point -
you say you would support her if she went to college but even though you agree that the apprenticeship would be a better career choice you 're prepared to penalise her for it .
If she was leaving school to get a normal job I would agree she should contribute but this is basically her still studying , just going about it in a slightly less conventional way .
Has she arranged to apply for this herself ?
That to me shows a lot of intitative and motivation for someone her age ,
rather then taking the more mainstream option of college she has looked into her options and gone for what will be best for her future career .
Apprentice wages are extremely low so while she is on those could you maybe look at a compromise -
eg you will still provide her room and board ( the same as you are doing for her sister ) but she has to pay all her expenses out of her wage , ie her travel to work , lunches there if she needs them , phone if she has it , any expenses she needs for work .
hmmmmmm hard one here !
Normally I would say yes , take a nominal amount from your DD 2 as she is now " working " , but as you are supporting DD 1 , I can see why she might be cheesed off .
I guess it depends on how much she is earning during her first year as an apprentice ......
Lets say , for talks sake , it 's GBP 100 a week ,
that 's still a lot of money for a school leaver who has no household expenses or food to pay .
Personally I would take a small amount , say GBP 20 a week from her and , as you said , put it in a savings account for if she does decide to go travelling in the future .
Explain to here that it may not seem fair , but she is now earning , and the cost of this compared to living away from home , is minimal . Or show her a breakdown of what a 1/3 of all household cost would be .
In regards to the car , does your DD 1 really NEED one ?
Of course it is easier for her to get home at weekends , but can she not get the train / bus ?
When I was at uni , I think I could count the number of students who lived away from home and had a car on one hand - the rest mnade do with a young persons railcard .
And will your DD 2 NEED a car ?
If the answer if no , neither of them really need it then I would suggest that they share the car ( 1 month on / off , for example ) .
A car for a teenager / student , is an expensive luxury and with the rising costs of insurance and fuel , most parents can not this for one child , let alone 2 .
Rockström said that when rich countries increase their consumption , they also accelerate the exploitation of the world 's national resources , with the result that they emit more greenhouse gases .
This will ultimately accelerate the speed of desertification in sub - Saharan African countries and other areas of the world .
The ice sheet has melted earlier this season .
Consequently , experts have predicted that the world has at least ten years within which to lower the volume of greenhouse gas emissions before it is too late to redeem the situation .

According to a report on Taiwan 's ETTV News website , the old man , who is 85 years old this year , was originally called Fu Hei - han , but as an officer thought this name to be uncultured when he enlisted in the army as a young man , he changed the name for him to Fu Hsing - han with the intended meaning of " making the Chinese world prosperous .

Li Jinhua hopes to see " the audit body audited " before he leaves office .
He said that establishing clean government was the very lifeline of audit work .

Audit cadres must require themselves to adhere to the standards they apply when auditing others .

Two years ago , a friend whom I had n't seen for many years found me , and said he wanted to do some business .

Sure enough it was n't long before my friend opened a one - yuan shoeshine shop on a busy street corner .
Otherwise , even given more opportunities , you can still lose them .

I 'll be returning to my country in September . Now there are two places I can go to . Can everyone help me see which is more suitable for me ?
1 . Chinese Academy of Sciences . To be trained according to the Hundred Talents Program and paid according to the Hundred Talents Program benefits , but there is no guarantee I will definitely get it .
Although there are still papers to be published after I return to my country , they 're quite useless for the application to the Hundred Talents Program .
2 . A second tier provincial university , professor , 150,000 - 200,000 yuan housing subsidy and 50,000 yuan research grant .
I can work on my current research topic .
I can only be an advisor for the Master 's program . They do n't have doctoral programs as of today .
My husband suggested that I go to 1 because the starting point is higher , the current pay is alright , and if I ca n't make it there in future I can still go to 2 .
The university is in the suburb ; the school district is fairly ordinary , and there are not many choices in terms of housing .

He just emailed that friend to ask him how much it cost .

Yi Jianlian was selected by Milwaukee Bucks as sixth pick but he was n't willing to play there , leading to much heated discussion recently .
Why must he go to a city with many Chinese people ?
Actually , so what if he goes to Milwaukee ? There is no superstar there , but this is exactly his chance .
Moreover , he is not qualified to bargain with his owner when he has yet to prove his power on the NBA court .
On second thought , he can absolutely play in another city when his rookie player contract ends after three to four years .
Yao 's team is obviously a notch better in terms of attitude and way of dealing with things . I really do not wish for Yi 's team to become the second Wang Zhizhi .

Four years of World War I ended in 1918 .
In early 1919 , Gu Weijun , the Chinese envoy to the United States , went to France to participate in the Paris Peace Conference as the plenipotentiary of his own country 's government .
Xiao Kejian , Gu Weijun 's good friend , was arrested by French police for organizing a strike in Paris to fight for equal pay for equal work for Chinese workers in France .
However , his extreme action of joining Korean revolutionists in bombing the hotel the Japanese delegation lived in made Korea and China the center of public opinion .
The Paris Peace Conference rejected China 's just request in the end and decided to let Japan take over Germany 's special rights over Jiaodong Peninsula .
This caused the momentous " May 4 th " Movement to break out in the country , and Xiao Kejian and others also protested in Paris .

The Israeli newspapers that were published yesterday devoted supplements to the one year anniversary of the July war , which covered the different aspects of this war and its repercussions on Israel .
According to Alof Ben in Haaretz , the biggest loser in this war is Ehud Olmert and the Kadima party , and the theory of unilateral Israeli withdrawals .
On the other hand , the war has strengthened the position of the right and its leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , and it helped to bring Ehud Barak back to the government .
But the most critical review is the one by Ben Kasbit in Maariv . He wrote : " Did we win the war that broke out exactly a year ago , or were we defeated ?
Not exactly .
But since Israel must win the confrontation with its enemy , the draw equals a defeat .
Is our position today better than what it was a year ago on the eve of the war ?
Is the position of Hezbollah better today than it was a year ago ?
No , the party has been dealt quite a major military blow , but from another point of view , it achieved an important moral victory .
It is true that it was pushed back off the border fence , but it is entrenching and fortifying itself to the north of the Litani .
It withstood its confrontation with the Israeli military might , but it lost many of its troops and lost the element of surprise .
Nasrallah is in a real hole and Olmert is in a virtual one , since his approval rate is almost equal to zero and the danger of the Vinograd report is lurking on the horizon .

Since the start of this campaign in April / " April " , warnings have been issued to thousands of women , among whom hundreds have been arrested for not abiding by the religious dress code .
Women , whether Iranian or foreign , have been required to wear the veil since the Islamic Revolution in the year 1979 , but recent years saw some relaxation , particularly with respect to wearing the veil .
The Ministry requested that the officers of this Committee hand over the persons whom they arrest to regular police forces , which are to carry out their own interrogations of them .
This religious police force is also under investigation following a campaign of raids during which an Asian woman fell to her death from the fifth floor last May in the region of Holy Mecca .
Al - Watan stated that this religious police force was the object of more than 20 complaints in the year 2006 .

A 74 - year - old homeless thief fulfilled his only wish , which was to return to jail for the next five years .

The Court also found that Newnham had been convicted on charges of shoplifting from stores almost every year over a period of 36 years .
Newnham said that robbing the bank was much easier than sorting out his affairs and his retirement spending outside the prison .
The issue therefore does not concern some opinions that provoke waves of objection , but rather it fundamentally concerns a vision of the role of the Church , its ideology , and its universal message .
So the beginning denied the relationship between Islam and reason , as though Islam is a religion that is hostile to reason and there is no place for reason in the Islamic faith .

EBay Announces Today It will Acquire Ticket Website StubHub for 310 Million US Dollars
eのsnail
According to the international reports on January 11 , eBay announced that it will acquire online ticket website StubHub for 310 million US dollars in cash to further expand its influence on electronic commerce .
The acquisition is expected to be completed before April .
More than six years ago , Jeff Fluhr and Stanford School of Business graduate Eric Baker founded StubHub with Fluhr as its chief executive officer .
Fluhr said in a statement : " StubHub 's business model is an excellent fit with eBay , and we have admired eBay for a long time . "
Over the past two years , as investors were concerned about the slowdown in eBay 's online auction business , its poor management , slow business expansion , and other factors , its market value has been dwindling .
In succession eBay acquired Internet phone service Skype and online price - comparison company Shopping.com .
StubHub mainly operates ticket brokerage to major events .
In 2006 its ticket sales was 400 million US dollars with annual profits reaching 100 million US dollars .
Ticket sellers selling tickets on this website must pay a 15 percent fee , while buyers also have to pay a 10 percent commission to StubHub .
As of now , five million tickets have been sold on the StubHub website .

I remember my first year studying at Qinghua , I went to my first elective course called " Inspirations in the History of Physics . "
There were only ten or so of us who had chosen it that semester .
The teacher was very erudite , his lectures were very lively ; he summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time I was enthralled .
In all my five years at the university , I never had another course that interesting .
If I were to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discoveries in physics all had their own necessity and theoretical basis ( for example , the development of mathematics ) .
This theory can also be applied to cooking .
One day I wanted to make green beans and bean curd sheets ( dried tofu in the Northeast ) .
Here the dried tofu sold in the stores is all compressed , very tough .
So I normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .
Because that day I needed to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , I set the timer and told my wife to turn off the heat when it was done .
My wife is very lazy , and when the timer sounded , she turned off the heat and left the pot sitting on the stove .
When I came back and looked , the dried tofu was white and soft , just like freshly made .
Chalk another good one up to the wife .
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Your uncle is just your uncle .
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes
This morning I went to the supermarket with Dad , and when it came time to check out I discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .
Of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .
Most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals .
In terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .
In fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup .
In terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories ( here I 'm being inaccurate ; I hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with IO expertise ) .
But with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co - workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people .
Below I am going to refer to these 200 people collectively as " his uncle . "
So whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : My uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney .
In other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .
Here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and I have it .
If Americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .
I believe that they made such a complete mess of the Middle East to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the Middle East , which is a completely different place from the United States .
On this issue , China does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; China 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever China does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
Therefore I believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .
We need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .
So just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .
When you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .
Well , gasoline in Richmond has has hit $ 3.00 a gallon , or just shy of it ,
and I spent $ 48 filling up the gas tank of my Jeep --
the most I 've ever paid for in my life .
I 'm not happy about it ,
but I do n't see high gas prices as a reason to start foaming at the mouth and chewing on the carpet .
Others feel less constrained .
The hysteria over rising gas prices has reached a fever pitch .
The economic ignorance of the sound bites and commentary I 've seen on national television knows no bounds .
Demagogues are calling for self - destructive taxes on oil company profits , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profits are a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
( 1 ) If you confiscate Exxon Mobil 's profits , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc.
( 2 ) If you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
Why bother if the profits will be taxed away ?
Here in Virginia , a semblance of sanity still reigns .
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine has not yet proposed anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposals emanating from Washington , D.C. .
The Governor has said he will investigate reports of " price gouging , " which , given the fact that the the concept of " price gouging " is meaningless and impossible to define , means he will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ....
Which is exactly what he should do .
Nothing .
Virginians and Americans will adapt to higher gas prices if government does not interfere .
( The Governor also is considering applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring cleaner gasoline be sold in Virginia 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination .
See the Times - Dispatch report .
Unfortunately , he 's sticking to his guns on trying to raise $ 1 billion for transportation projects without raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post .
As I have been hammering away relentlessly on this blog ( See " A World with One Billion Cars " ) , the world economy is moving from a 20 - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
This shift is driven by the combination of ( a ) escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like China and India , and ( b ) the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .
This is not the oil companies ' fault .
This is not Dick Cheney 's fault .
This is not the auto industries ' fault .
It is not the environmentalists ' fault .
It 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
The American public can adapt to the new global realities by changing their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politicians can help them by speaking honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline is increasing , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
Here in Virginia , the General Assembly has been examining what Virginia can do to increase energy production .
That is OK , as far as it goes .
But there is nothing that Virginia can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed to convert oil to gasoline .
What the political and business leadership of Virginia has so far failed utterly to do is admit that Virginia is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .
Virginians consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy is geared toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulating travel demand .
But reality is a stubborn thing .
With each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order becomes increasingly evident .
Let us hope that Gov. Kaine , who prides himself on straight talk , begins leveling with the people of Virginia .
Jim - You are right on the money about how capitalism works ,
so why not try to make capitalism really work for Virginia .
The future in transportation belongs to the nation , company or person who develops the alternative to gasoline powered automobiles .
Why not do everything we can to assure that future arises from Virginia ?
Rather than drilling for oil and gas off the Atlantic Coast , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who want to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .
You can encourage R&D on alternative fuels with grants and tax breaks .
AND , you can work to increase supply .
The one and only oil refinery in the Commonwealth is nearby in Yorktown .
They could double their capacity without leaving the premises .
Why has n't the company applied to do builf new facilities on site ?
By all means explore for oil and gas in the Atlantic .
Jim : Speaking seriously here , many families ( including my own ) have already cut back in every way possible .
What then ?
My office , home and children 's schools are all within a 6 mile radius .
Vacations are already a thing of the past .
We 've cut back on groceries .
I 'd trade the car on a hybrid ,
but it 's paid for
and who can afford a car payment what with mortgage rates being what they are and three kids ...
So , I ask seriously , what are average hard - working families to do ?
Andrea : How about a couple of hundred dollars ?
If the GA repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
Or , the GA could actually cut the sales tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
Check out how much the Republican Senators want you to pay in other , new taxes too - to register your car , etc.
Jim : I like the graphic ,
it takes two arms and two legs to fill up our tank .
The only answer to cutting the cost of mobility and access is settlement patterns that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient shared - vehicles when one must resort to any vehicle .
That is what an understanding of Jane Jacobs suggested 40 years ago ( not just in " Life and Death ... but also " The Economy of ' Cities ' . "
Let us , honor Ms. Jacobs 's memory with an understanding of the need for Fundamental Change .
EMR
JAB - Got ta love it .
Yup , a couple of hundred dollars is going to save the day !
Jane Jacobs knew the difference between a community and a construction plan .
Was n't one of her main arguments that you can not plan everything , and you should allow communities to be what they are and what they become ?
Did n't she fight Robert Moses because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?
Somehow I doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning .
Andrea , One option may be telecommuting a couple of days a week .
Other than that , here 's the hard truth :
There 's not much that average , hard - working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
What you should NOT do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse , not better .
In the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options .
You should support development patterns that allow compatible uses ( houses , small office buildings , small retail shops ) to be located close to each rather than scattered all over .
How much money could you save if you could get by with only one car instead of two ?
What would it mean if you lived in a place where your children could walk to school ?
Think outside the box .
Kingfish , I 'm all in favor of alternate fuels .
Converting biomass to ethanol seems to be one that is self - sustaining economically without massive incentives .
I 'd favor government - sponsored research to devise technologies that would make ethanol more competitive ,
but I do n't like the idea of subsidizing specific business enterprises .
Once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter how much the world changes around them .
Witness the mohair subsidies put into place during World War II .
I tend to agree with Jim that markets function best , so long as no one has a finger on the scale .
Many believe that zone pricing , which is generally used by oil companies , is inconsistent with our antitrust laws ( Section 13 of the Robinson - Patman Act ) .
Others disagree .
Does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale ?
If so , should the GA outlaw zone pricing ?
Toomanytaxes : Zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .
Only , we pay the extra few cents per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation accounts .
Considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .
I was recently on the webpage for the Energy Information Agency
and their cost of fuel adjusted for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at $ 3 per gallon measured in 2005 dollars before .
It is about the historic peak in real prices ,
but it is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating .
It is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
and that is not a bad outcome at all .
Like you , Jim , I see the bright silver lining .
I seem to be getting more questions whenever I pull up in my hybrid .
One data point .
2:53 Why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between Prince William and Fairfax Counties and even at different locations within the same county ?
Zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates .
Take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
Assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map ,
differences in do not explain zone pricing .
Look at Arizona , for example .
There are much higher transportation costs in and around the Grand Canyon and much more competition in the Phoenix market .
Yet , Phoenix prices tend to be signficantly higher .
Ditto for taxes .
From what I quickly found on the Internet , total fuel taxes for the following four states are VA ( 37.7 cents ) ; Utah ( 42.5 cents ) ; NC ( 45.6 cents ) and Montana ( 46.2 cents ) .
However , both Montana and Utah have average prices that are significantly lower than either VA or NC .
There 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe .
I had a conversation with a friend the other day who owns an SUV
and he is n't worried about the price of gas because he travels less than 10 miles a day ..
yes ..
it 'll cost more ...
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... two cups rather than three . :-)
seriously - it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like " I must and have no choice " .
It takes a hard knock for folks to take a hard look at things they always assumed could not change .
I predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice " is truly no choice .
I know it happened during the gas crisis ...
and as bad as it is now - this is not as bad as then - though if $ 3 a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ 4 a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ...
.. but I would bet that folks would choose ( there 's that word again ) $ 4 or even $ 5 a gallon rather than waiting in line for 3 hours only to find out the guy in front of you got the last tankful .
America 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though I doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :-)
sorry .. my attitude is grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ...
my property accessment going up 300 % ( which it did ) ...
... and today .. I paid $ 68 bucks to fill up my 89 Ford Van .
I got ta talk to Ray Hyde about that Hybrid .... he 's got ..
he said if he had to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :-)
Did I really say that ?
That would be a tough " choice " .
With the truck I 'd have some chance of making money ,
but I 'd hate to have to drive it if it was n't working .
If you have to drive , the hybrid is a joy .
Dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
48 mpg if you drive at 75 + like a maniac .
I remember people sniffing at it , saying they would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there .
I drone on about costs and benefits , but a ) that 's not everything , and b ) sometimes circumstances change .
I 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
I have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
I need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current " tax " plan is going to kill me .
I sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this :
send a letter .
I do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what I owe ,
but this is going to be whacked .
I suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices .
That gas station in Fairfax is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes .
Businesses are " tax positive " do n't cha know .
If people really do start making different choices , it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices .
BTW 13 % more new home sales last year , in spite of higher rates ,
but prices were down 5k .
Time to demand another reassessment .
Ray Hyde : Taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices .
But I still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data - mining than actual costs .

If you 're Arlington County , you create a new vision for the boxy buildings and subterranean passageways in Crystal City that will be emptied by the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission .
In place of the sterile monoculture that now characterizes the office complex near the Pentagon , members of an advisory task force see a more lively street - level scene with a greater mix of shops , restaurants and offices .
Writes WaPo reporter Annie Gowen :
[ Board of Supervisors Chairman Chris ] Zimmerman and others speaking yesterday said that the vounty sees the empty space as an opportunity to " reimagine " and " brand " Crystal City as an attractive destination .
Though close to Reagan National Airport and dense with hotels , the area has long been seen as a gloomy 1960s era enclave of offices connected by underground passages .
But parts of Crystal City have lately seen a rebirth , thanks to an influx of trendy cafes and a new streetscape ....
Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty , which owns 7.4 million of the 11 million square feet of office space in the neighborhood , has spent $ 40 million on improvements to enliven the streets and attract new businesses .
It turned Crystal Drive into a two - way main street and has recruited new shops and chic restaurants such as Jaleo and McCormick & Schmick 's .
Reading between the lines of Gowen 's story , however , there seems to be one big missing piece :
Housing .
Creating a livelier commercial district is a worthy goal .
But creating a balanced community with a mix of housing , offices , shopping and other amenities -- allowing people to live close to where they work and play -- is an even more worthy goal .
As Ed Risse has pointed out , the relocation of 17,000 jobs creates a rare opportunity to create a genuine balanced communities in Northern Virginia .
The problem , I surmise -- it 's not discussed in the story -- is that Arlington is concerned about protecting its tax base , which means replacing the vacated offices with new offices , not housing .
It 's hard to fault Arlington for pursuing its short - term self interest .
But everyone needs to recognize that Arlington 's decision not to pursue a balanced community means that housing will end up somewhere else , presumably in outlying counties .
And employees working in the buffed up Crystal City will wind up commuting long distances and clogging Northern Virginia thoroughfares .
So I work in that same beauty salon ,
I 'm chained to the old masquerade
The lipstick , the shadow , the silicone :
I follow my father 's trade -
Leonard Cohen
Michael Jackson may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveals more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
Almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
Yesterday , Jackson was ordered to close Neverland for having failed to pay the ranch 's 47 employees their salary or insurance since the end of 2005 .
Unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise .
He 's moved on since his aquittal , like Gary Glitter did after his 1999 conviction , having departed last June for a Bahrain " vacation " from which he 's yet to emerge .
( " For the people working at Bahrain 's malls , the person covered head to toe in a black veil , gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich , doting Saudi mother ....
But why would a woman wear a man 's shoes ?
Why the bodyguards ?
And why did the person 's fluid movements seem so familiar ? " )
Last week 's real Jackson story ran in the New York Daily News , under the snappy banner " Creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . "
The singer was brother Jermaine , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned " tell - all " family story .
Reading that Joseph was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a " stop the presses " moment .
What 's new is this :
Jermaine even suggested his father may have set up Michael to be somehow victimized by older men .
He tells how his father would have Michael join in at late - night hotel room meetings with " important business people , " and wondered whether " something happened " to Michael at those sessions .
He said he sensed something was wrong because Michael would be sick for days after .
" What was Joseph doing ? " Jermaine wrote .
This lifts the Jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege .
This should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
Or maybe not : " LaToya also described being awakened in the night by Joseph wearing a ' monster mask . ' "
Perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the Jackson clan had gotten with the program .
Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre - existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .
( This is how I tend to think of Ponchatoula 's Hosanna Church . )
Yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of Michael 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations .
His close friendship with SPECTRA contactee and channeller of the Nine , Uri Geller , for one instance .
( Jackson was Geller 's best man in 2001 when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year Geller is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . )
His entourage including a " personal magician " for another .
Even if you wanted to , you wo n't be reading Jermaine 's account now .
Like every Jackson sibling who 's tried to break from Joe , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of Michael 's threats to sue .
Previously , Michael 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father .
Yet there they were at Jackson 's trial last year , hand in hand .
But his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests .
good stuff .
having departed last June for a Bahrain " vacation " from which he 's yet to emerge .
Actually , there have been reports for the past two days of Jackson back in California .
#NAME ?
Wild wild stuff Jeff !
Disinformation Distraction Dis and Dat ..
Bait and switch sets the agenda .
There is no such thing as an accident .
It 's Saturday morning , and the papers say a moon of Saturn is spewing life - giving water .... then I see the new R.I. post is about the perrenial child Michael Jackson .
This day is named for Saturn ...
" ... it was foretold that one day a mighty son of Saturn would in turn overthrow him ,
and Saturn devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this ... "
Apparently Saturn is also intimately connected with Satan , Masonics , and Revelation 13 - you know , the " number of the beast " ...
Nevermind -
I need a cup of coffee ...
I looked in vain for the Cheney " A hunting we will go " to post this out and paste but ...
And on the subject of cowardice , consider this . In a recent hunting escapade , Dick Cheney accidentally shot one of his hunting comrades .
There may have been negligence involved , but that is up to the local district attorney to decide .
But more importantly , I think , is the nature of the hunt .
These were not wild birds .
The birds were bred in captivity .
They had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by Dick Cheney and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom .
The link " personal majician " is intrigueing .
From Madsen via Boucher :
Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo , George W. Bush 's White House director of the Office of Faith - based Initiatives .
Kuo also previously worked for the Christian Coalition and Senator John Ashcroft .
There 's also some curious Neverland / Disneyland connections to the " Mickey Mouse Club " children who are now stars , including Justin Timberlake ( remember the star on Janet Jackson 's breast ? ) and Brittany Spears , Christina Aguilera ...
The piper walks into the mountain , still followed by the children , and the cave closes again ...
Here is Boucher 's follow up to the " majician " link of Jeff 's .
but i thought you might cover chile 's inauguration of its first woman president today instead ...
maybe later as the story develops ?
Jeff Boucher 's piece mentions how victims of sexual abuse often have childlike voices , almost as if their development was ' frozen ' around the time of their abuse .
Jackson seems to be of this type .
Or more perversely , fakes that he is :
" I was always saying [ to Jackson ] people would n't think I was so crazy if they saw who the hell you really are , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're [ expletive ] funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time " -
Lisa Marie Presley , in an interview quoted in a WaPo article written by Tina Brown :
Michael Jackson 's False Front ?
" David Geffen , be gone !
Steven Spielberg , be gone ! "
The witch doctor cursing Michael Jackson 's enemies and blessing the tarnished King of Pop himself in a voodoo ritual in Switzerland in the summer of 2000 had promised that the 25 people on Jackson 's enemies list ( would soon be dead ) ...
Jackson had ordered his then business adviser , Myung - Ho Lee , a U.S. - educated Korean lawyer based in Seoul , to wire $ 150,000 to a bank in Mali for a voodoo chief named Baba , who then had 42 cows ritually sacrificed for the ceremony .
Jackson had already undergone a blood bath ...
The pop star , who is said to be $ 240 million in debt , had paid six figures for a ritual cleansing using sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious Egyptian woman named Samia , who came to him with a letter of greeting from a high - ranking Saudi prince , purportedly Nawaf Bin Abdulaziz Al - Saud , now the chief of intelligence of Saudi Arabia ...
http://www.vanityfair.com/commentary/content/articles/050411roco03c hmm .
According to that Vanity Fair article , Jacko and Uri Geller met through " that other fellow devotee of children 's charities Mohamed Fayed , the chairman of Harrods in London , who believes that the C.I.A. and Prince Philip had Princess Diana and his son , Dodi , killed . "
Anonymous quoted , " Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo ... "
Hold on --
the Cedars is the headquarters of the Fellowship Foundation , the creepy Christianoid cult with deep political connections .
Here 's a bit of the original Madsen article that the Michael Jackson quote comes from :
In 1976 , the Fellowship began looking for a permanent headquarters in Arlington .
It set its sights on the estate of George Mason IV , The Cedars , located at 2301 North Uhle Street .
Mason was one of the drafters of the Bill of Rights .
The Fellowship , also known as the International Foundation , bought the property from Charles Piluso .
Although not much is known about Piluso , the Los Angeles Times reported that Howard Hughes , the man with whom Fellowship Senator Ralph Owen Brewster once sparred , also lived there .
According to a senior Pentagon official , the Cedars had been used as a CIA safe house prior to the Fellowship 's purchase of the estate .
The Fellowship paid $ 1.5 million for the Cedars , the money coming from Tom Phillips , the CEO of Raytheon , and Ken Olsen , the CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation .
Sanford McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas Corporation was another deep - pocketed supporter of the Fellowship through Full Gospel Business Men 's Fellowship International , an activity linked to Fellowship core member Pat Robertson .
Suffer the little children , eh ?
If this is what power & wealth does to you , I 'm damn glad I have neither .
You said , " Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre - existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . "
Could n't agree more .
I think that pedophilia 's relative commonality is what really makes it frightening .
My experience happened when I was 15 .
A friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
We were both enamored with Kerouac & Jim Morrison & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill .
He was muscle for a Pittsburgh madam named Tex Gill .
She dressed like a man & ran most of the massage parlors in Pgh .
He was into black magick & Crowley & booze & drugs & on & on .
& my buddy passes out .
I continue drinking .
At one point , I glance at this older guy ,
& he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth & drips on to the floor .
He notices that I 'm kind of staring at him .
He stands up , walks into the bedroom , & comes back with a porno mag .
He drops it on the couch next to me .
As he 's sitting down , he says , " See anything you like ? "
& then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....
.... & I broke his nose with my elbow .
I apologize for continuing my ramble but ... ,
MICHAEL JACKSON
MANCHILD IN A PROMISED LAND
by ROBERT J. LEWIS
He 's such an easy target , Michael Jackson .
He makes even the weirdest of the weird feel normal .
But unlike them , Jackson does n't try to hide the fact that he is easily one of the most screwed up beings on the planet .
Every time he checks in for yet another surgery , he is announcing to the world that he does n't know who he is , where he is going , and that he thoroughly loathes himself - at least the adult version .
And for his remarkable honesty , his most unprivate confessions , he is subjected to one public humiliation after another .
Who among us rock throwers would have the courage to reveal about ourselves what Michael has revealed about himself ?
Next to the towering monument that the unedited Michael Jackson is we are telephone booths ;
next to his singular guilelessness and candor , we are the multitude of the prevaricating and pusillanimous .
Everything Michael has done and said during the past 20 years has been against his own apparent self - interest , beginning with unrelenting surgical assaults on his erstwhile good looks , to hanging his child ( and crotch for that matter ) out to dry , to entering details of his bedroom antics into the public domain .
Like a typical Dostoievksy character , we can not account for the behavior if it were n't for an apparently overriding need to confess and proclaim -- over and against what the outside world wants to believe -- the truth of who we are .
The on - going spectacle of Michael 's increasingly bizarre conduct is his confession to the world that he is one spectacularly psychologically - challenged dude .
Like children who are incapable of dissimulating their basic wants and needs , Michael 's manner of being in the world is uncensored and spontaneous ,
and to such an unsuspected extent I propose he deserves to be considered one of the most authentic beings of this or any other century , and quite properly belongs to that exceptional society of authenticity - questers that would include Saint Augustine , Pascal and Heidegger .
The facts of Michael 's life have been well documented .
We know that by the age of 25 he was on top of the world .
Thriller had sold an unprecedented 50 million copies and Billie Jean had become the musical drug of choice in every corner of the world .
Not only was the song 's momentum and tension brilliantly crafted and fused , Michael 's riveting , counterpoint choreography - which remains unsurpassed -- revolutionized the way we simultaneously look at and listen to music .
Before disbelieving eyes , his torso , head and limbs supplied never - before - seen anatomical rejoinders to the notes -- like a guitarist filling in between the lyrics .
But from here on in , it would be downhill for the genre 's quintessential messenger , for Michael could no longer sustain the ' great lie ' he was living .
The child 's ' tin drum ' was beating ever louder in his head
and he intuitively understood that he was developmentally under - equipped to handle the adult pressures of stardom .
Far more compelling than the promise of even greater fame and fortune was the example of Oskar , from Gunther Grass ' The Tin Drum ( 1959 ) , which tells the story of a boy who refuses to grow up , who , through his drumming , rejects the adult world and the horrors taking place in Nazi Germany .
Like Oskar , Michael had witnessed firsthand the abominations of adult behaviour and refused to sign up .
From his earliest years , Michael Jackson was subjected to both extreme psychological and physical abuse at the hands of his status - obsessed father , who designated Michael as the vessel into which he would mercilessly pour the acid of his unrealized ambitions .
To this single end , Joe Jackson was ruthlessly single - minded .
Michael was terrified of him , whose mere presence could induce nausea .
At the age of 5 , the father yanked the son from his pail and sandbox existence and made him run Hollywood 's grimmest gauntlets .
The little mouse that Michael was suddenly found himself in the rat race and quickly learned to hate it ,
and like Oskar , who found respite in the beating of his tin drum , Michael found solace on stage , performing his music .
But the stage could not provide Michael with immunity against the constant encroachment of the adult world .
Listen to his rapid breathing in especially Off the Wall and Thriller : the staccato - like panting of a stalked animal , the desperate breath of human panic , and his small boy 's voice hiding behind the mesmerizing slash and blur of arms and legs fending off an invisible attack .
From one track to the next , the lyrics are n't so much sung as frantically whispered , the vowels cut short to the quick .
Michael was announcing that he could no longer follow the course Father and Hollywood had staked out for him , that the disparity between his real self and the role he was thrust into had reached unsustainable incommensurability .
Only the child within could save the defenceless adult from the depredations of the adult world ,
and from this point on , Michael would reduce the project of his life to letting the world know the truth of who he was : a confused , fragile , lost soul in search of care and love .
By the time Michael had attained mythic status , he was so far removed and alienated from himself , he would have to shed , over a period of 20 years and still counting , one skin after another before his true self could begin to emerge .
As we might expect from someone so radically self - estranged , the result has been nothing less than a metamorphosis .
Michael 's journey of self - discovery is a work in progress like no other because it increasingly depends on the accommodation of two irreconcilables : the child and adult as one .
More revealing of itself than its favorite target , public opinion has not seen fit to grant Michael the inalienable right to his confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment .
If most people subscribe to the notion that black and white are not only skin colors but states of mind , why are we baffled or offended when Michael , who was introduced to the white ways of Hollywood at the age of 5 , tells us that he is n't sure what his true color is ?
Robbed of his childhood , abused by a psychotic father and then prematurely subjected to the adult pressures of the entertainment world , why are we surprised to learn that Michael does n't want to grow up , that he prefers the company and community of children , that he wants to be protected and looked after ?
Every time the androgynous Jackson goes under the knife he is crying out that he does n't know if he is man or woman , child or adult , black or white .
As if we would have done otherwise in his situation ?
And to the never - ending suspicion that Michael is a child abuser , what crime has been committed when two experimenting 11 - year - olds fool around sexually ?
If you believe that Michael has the mentality of an 11 - year - old , ( and there has n't been much evidence to the contrary during the past 20 years ) he should not have had to defend himself against accusations of child molestation .
Was it in defense of perversity or his incorrigible innocence that convinced him that it was OK to reveal that he shared his bed with children ?
More questionable , even criminal , than Michael 's alleged fooling around with other kids , were the parents who allowed , even encouraged their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilections have been suspect since 1991 .
On June 13 , 2005 , the courts found Michael not guilty of the charges brought against him .
However , those whose minds were decided on his guilt before the trial began will not be changed by the verdict , just as Michael 's essential nature will not have changed .
Mahatma Gandhi writes that ' There is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience . '
Only Michael knows if he is sexually attracted to children , and beyond that , if he has ever acted on those feelings .
And if we grant him the mental age of an 11 - year - old , who has nonetheless conventionally fathered two children , Michael is then a child trapped in an adult body .
Which means the crowning act in his quest for authenticity awaits one final operation .
What does a man do when he feels , acts and responds like a woman trapped in a man 's body ?
He undergoes sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' she ' is .
There remains one final procedure that will totally liberate the child that Michael is .
When Michael finds the courage to act on what his duty toward other children demands -- submit to voluntary neutering -- which will be tantamount to his final confession , the saving grace and glory that is his Neverland will become his forever land .
Tennessee Williams has said for all time , " there 's not enough kindness in the world . "
And I say this to you , Michael Jackson , may your tribe increase .
" Thank God I 'm an atheist : "
The surrealistic cinema of Luis Bunuel --
by Bryan M. Papciak
" The thought of death has been familiar to me for a long time , " says Director Luis Bunuel .
" From the time that skeletons were carried through the streets of Calanda during the Holy Week procession , death has been an integral part of my life .
I 've never wished to forget or deny it ,
but there 's not much to say about it when you 're an atheist " ( 255 ) .
So reads an accurate testimonial to the personal and artistic sentiment of this odd and serious filmmaker .
Like many of his contemporary surrealists , Bunuel is a paradox who on one hand claims apathy towards ultimate end , being , and Being , yet on the other hand loads his impressive body of work with moribund imagery and strange ideas about the God he so vociferously denies .
Bunuel exhibits a radical , iconoclastic view of the world in which he finds society decadent and antithetical to human liberation .
He has been called a realist , a surrealist , a Marxist , an anarchist , a mystic , an anticleric , a Freudian , a post - Freudian , a sadist , a moralist , a Christian , and a poet - showman of the macabre .
His scenarios range from the absurd to the tragic to the satiric to the erotic , profusely endued with the outrageous and the scandalous .
Luis Bunuel has long been recognized in European critical circles as a great and prolific filmmaker on a par with Eisenstein , Chaplin , and Fellini .
However , only recently has his reputation in America begun to catch up .
Over his fifty - year career he directed thirty - two feature films and worked in Spain , France , Mexico , Italy , and the United States .
Utilizing sardonic humor and the imagery of surrealism , Bunuel set out to undermine the values and institutions people take for granted .
His aims were specific : through the surreal , visualizing the impulses of the uncon - scious , he would , he said , " shatter the optimism of the bourgeoisie world and force the reader ( or spectator ) to question the permanency of the prevailing order " ( Mellen 3 ) .
Luis Bunuel was born February 22 , 1900 in Calanda , a small town in the province of Teruel , Spain .
As a youth he received a Jesuit education , displaying exceptional talent in music , athletics , and the natural sciences .
He enjoyed a comfortable upbringing in a reasonably wealthy , close - knit family .
His family came from liberal , semi - intellectual , land - owning bourgeoisie .
These details are not irrelevant .
To comprehend Bunuel 's works it is essential to understand that he was first a Spaniard and secondly a product of Spanish bourgeoisie .
Virginia Higgenbotham points out that " blasphemy is only a form of thinking for any intelligent Spaniard , " and also that the " art of his country is rich in eroticism and profoundly preoccupied with death " ( 18 , 20 ) .
Bunuel says : My infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere ( like that of nearly all the Spanish provinces ) between my native town and Zaragova .
I feel it necessary to say here ( since it explains in part the trend of the modest work which I later accomplished ) that the two basic sentiments of my childhood which stayed with me well into adolescence , are those of a profound eroticism , at first sublimated in a great religious faith , and a permanent consciousness of death .
It would take too long here to analyze the reasons .
It suffices that I was not an exception among my compatriots , since this is a very Spanish characteristic , and our art , exponent of the Spanish spirit , was impregnated with these two sentiments .
The last civil war , peculiar and ferocious as no other exposed them clearly .
Coming of age , Bunuel expressed a strong urge to go to Paris to study music but was sent instead to Madrid to study agricultural engineering .
After a few years , he switched his studies to entomology , and , more importantly , began forming close friendships with a group of young artists who were to influence him strongly in the future .
These companions included the poets Frederico Garcia Lorca and Jose Moreno Villa and the painter Salvador Dali .
In the Madrid residencia Bunuel developed his interest in the arts , theater , and acting and gained his introduction to surrealism .
After graduating in 1925 with a degree in Philosophy and Letters , Bunuel moved to Paris , joined by a few members of his residencia coterie .
Bunuel arrived in Paris highly recommended by influential friends of his parents and was introduced into the best intellectual circles of the city .
He was soon hired as an Assistant Director to Jean Epstien , " the only director of that bleak era of the French cinema to merit the title of an intellectual filmmaker " ( Aranda 32 ) .
While honing his skills working as an A.D. , Bunuel also began contributing articles to various literary cinema periodicals , most notably La Gaceta Hispanoamericana .
In 1929 he formally entered the Paris Surrealist Group .
Within this setting he embarked on his first film project as director , a collaboration with his residencia friend Salvador Dali , entitled Un Chien Andalou .
He collaborated with Dali again in 1930 on another surrealist film , L_Age d ' Or .
The rest , as they say , is history .
Some critics , most notably Pauline Kael and Penelope Gilliatt , now regard Bunuel as the Hitchcock of surrealism -- a venerated master in total command of his medium and for whom the art of filmic manipulation became a " delightful form of play . "
For Bunuel , however , play had little to do with it .
Rather , he saw surrealism as a revolutionary , poetic , and moral movement :
All of us were supporters of a certain concept of revolution , and although the surrealists did n't consider themselves terrorists , they were constantly fighting a society they despised .
The principle weapon was not guns , of course , it was scandal .
Scandal was a potent agent of revelation , capable of exposing such social crimes as exploitation of one man by another , colonialist imperialism , religious tyranny -- in sum , all the secret and odious underpinnings of a system that had to be destroyed .
He went on to say , " The purpose of surrealism was not to create a new literary , artistic , or even philosophical movement , but to explode the social order , to transform life itself ' ( 107 ) .
Salvador Dali recalled the surrealists ' ideology , " It is possible to systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality " ( Gould 37 ) .
Indeed , the intent of surreal art is to move one from the conscious mind into the subconscious .
It seeks to affect the emotions through the mind .
Michael Gould states in Surrealism and the Cinema , " If the vision revealed is too much for the rational mind to absorb ( too intense , too threatening , too ' real ' ) yet can not be rejected , then it leaves the consciousness and comes to exist on a sublime level as pure surrealism " ( 13 ) .
In Un Chien Andalou , for example , a girl 's eye is sliced with a razor blade ,
a man wipes his mouth completely off his face ,
dead donkey carcasses adorn a piano ,
a man 's hand crawls with ants .
Each of these images is clearly too intense for rational thought .
Bunuel was drawn to the surrealist movement for more than revolutionary or psychological reasons .
The moral aspects of the movement intrigued him as well :
For the first time in my life , I 'd come into contact with a coherent moral system that , as far as I could tell , had no flaws .
It was an aggressive morality based on the complete rejection of all existing values .
We had other criteria :
we exalted passion , mystification , black humor , the insult , and the call of the abyss .
Inside this new territory , all our thoughts and actions seemed justifiable ;
there was simply no room for doubt .
Everything made sense .
Our morality may have been more demanding and more dangerous than the prevailing order , but it was also stronger , richer , more coherent .
The surreal qualities in Bunuel 's films can be traced to a number of sources ,
but the primary impetus was his " irrational sensibility " as evidenced by his treatment of image , montage , and sound .
These gave his films their dreamlike quality .
His most intense images are evocative of either humor or mystery .
Mystery , he believed , is the essential element of any art ;
it is inseparable from chance ,
and the whole universe is a mystery ,
Bunuel believed that his own form of atheism led inevitably to the acceptance of the inexplicable .
" Since I reject the idea of a divine watchmaker , " he said , " ( a notion even more mysterious than the mystery it supposedly explains ) , then I must consent to live in a kind of shadowy confusion ....
At least it keeps my moral freedom intact " ( 174 ) .
Predictably , adherence to fantasy as opposed to reason in a rationalistic society leads to conflict .
The surrealists opposed nearly all traditional values and , as noted before , sought to destroy " all conventional social , moral , and artistic habits of thought and perception " ( Higgenbotham 30 ) .
Enter Un Chien Andalou .
In 1929 , Un Chien Andalou was as shocking and scandalous as Bunuel and Dali had hoped it would be .
It gave rise to a staggering range of interpretations : poetic , scandalous , incoherent , an attack upon critics , an attack upon religion , and attack upon the bourgeoisie .
( Interestingly , the film was financed by Bunuel 's bourgeois mother . )
Un Chien Andalou ( which means An Andalusian Dog -- though there are no dogs in the film ) was deliberately intended to jolt the spectator 's peace of mind and to convey some of the basic beliefs underlying the surrealist movement , including the omnipotence of desire .
Bunuel stated that he and Dali held to only one rule during the production ,
" No idea or image that might lend itself to rational explanation of any kind would be accepted .
We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us without trying to explain why " ( 104 ) .
The aim of the film was not exclusively to shock , but to incendiarially affect the collective conscience .
At the same time it was an indictment of all the art consumers who , either through stupidity , masochism , or self interest , were willing to swallow anything , no matter how much it went against their instincts .
Bunuel asked , " What can I do about the people who adore all that is new , even when it goes against their deepest convictions , or about the insincere , corrupt press and the inane herd that saw beauty and poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate call for murder ? " ( Bauche 9 ) .
The film is a dream and , like a dream , is both fascinating and disturbing .
The opening scene in which a girl 's eye is sliced sets the tone of the film 's meandering and confusing itinerary .
Many of the elements that make up the film are remnants of objective reality .
The way they are arranged within the scenario pushes them into a mental reconstruction process -- in exactly the way dreams draw on the previous day 's experience .
Interestingly , the images have the matter - of - fact quality of a newsreel , or what Higgenbotham calls a " prosaic realism " ( 38 ) .
Bunuel chose not to use the distorted lenses , supered images , or blurred focus ( cinematic conventions of the day ) to suggest the dreamlike quality of his film .
Instead , he approached the entire non - narrative in a straightforward manner .
He used the shocking incongruity of the images themselves to build the hallucinatory feeling of anguish that runs through the film .
The unrealistic fashion in which the realistic images were juxtaposed was the perfect way , according to Freddy Bauche , to illustrate " the dramatic collision between desire and the object of desire " ( 10 ) .
Obviously , the director drew much of Un Chien Andalou from his Spanish heritage -- the religious and social implications , the themes of emotionalism and death , even the donkey carcasses .
" Thus Un Chien Andalou , as a milestone in the history of cinema , emerges from its director 's adolescence in Spain and announces the themes and techniques that were to preoccupy Bunuel for half a century , through the rest of his career " ( Higgenbotham 39 ) .
Where desire and eroticism prevailed in Un Chien Andalou , religion took center stage in Simon del Desierto ( Simon of the Desert ) , produced in Mexico in 1965 .
Simon del Desierto is a bizarre little narrative set in the fifth century A.D.
Saint Simon , in order to be as close to God as possible , has stood praying on top of a sixty - foot pillar for thirty - seven years .
He is profoundly sanctimonious - to the degree that he even blesses his own tooth when it falls from his mouth .
His devotion , however , is put to the test when the Devil ( a woman wearing the uniform of a Catholic school girl ) arrives in a slithering coffin at the pillar .
She is intent on luring the Holy Disciple from his perch as she repeatedly ridicules him and insults his character .
Simon heroically resists her temptations at every turn despite her various disguises ; first , a priest , then a shepherd , and finally as the Savior himself .
At last , despite Simon 's holy strength , and for reasons not entirely clear , the Devil is able to exert her full power and whisk him away to hell -- a Greenwich village disco where trendies writhe and grind to " The Radioactive Flesh . "
The implications are staggering .
" The saint , devoted to his god , sits high on a pillar for all of life ....
But the pillar , discolored over the years , winding and twisting its way to the ground , is the excrement of the saint .
Saint though he is , his bowels must still move .
So there he sits , near God indeed , but supported on a pillar of excrement " ( Mellen 115 ) .
There have been several interpretations of this seemingly blasphemous imagery .
One is that God and his church are really built on unacknowledged humanity .
Another is that we can reach God only through understanding the true nature of our humanity .
Still another is that religion ( primarily Catholicism ) is essentially a " pillar of excrement . "
Bunuel himself put all the interpretations in perspective when he said , " Thank God I 'm still an atheist . "
Luis Bunuel 's flair for perverse surrealism and his malicious attacks on conventional morality were fully realized in his second to last film , Le Fantome de la Liberte ( The Phantom of Liberty ) , produced in France in 1974 -- almost fifty years after Un Chien Andalou .
Fantome in many ways functioned as a sort of sequel to his 1972 film , Le Channe Discret de la Bourgeoisie ( The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie ) .
The images are astounding and playfully absurd :
Spanish hostages of the Napoleonic war cry " Down with Freedom ! " as they are executed .
A French lieutenant fondles the statue of a beautiful noblewoman and is struck on the head by another statue .
Bourgeois couples discuss defecation around a toilet - lined table but consider " food " an impolite topic , and so on .
The titular reference to a " phantom " boffows from the opening line of Karl Marx 's Communist Manifesto :
" A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of communism . "
Bunuel twists this meaning to imply that the specter haunting the bourgeoisie is " the possibility of its own freedom unburdened by the dead ends of sexual license , willful irrationality , and the liberty to go beyond the self - indulgent eccentricities of the individual ego " ( Mellen 318 ) .
Bunuel compared the film to one of his earlier surrealist works , L_Age d ' Or , saying , " It is no longer possible to scandal - ize people as we did in 1930 .
Today you have to do it with sweet subversion " ( Mellen 183 ) .
Le Fantome de la Liberte charges that society has substituted arbitrary willfulness for freedom .
One of the film 's vignettes shows two parents who insist on declaring their daughter a missing person , although she is plainly sitting in front of them .
The police , in a similar display of willful blindness to reality , even ask the child herself for her vital statistics and how she disappeared .
In another episode , four chain - smoking monks gamble with their holy medallions in a card game .
" I 'll open with a virgin , " says one .
Another plays a " father . "
Bunuel believed reality is actually a smoke screen for hidden urges .
He used the absurd to imply " an attack on specific abuses , not on some safely vague condition of man " ( Durgnat 65 ) .
In Le Fantome de la Liberte Bunuel doubts not so much the possibility for society 's redemption as its likelihood .
" We have been rendered unwittingly comfortable within our psychic cages to the point where we prefer them to liberty , an experience and aspiration we neither understand or desire " ( Mellen 331 ) .
For fifty years , Luis Bunuel made films about society 's dilemmas .
His art is his declaration of confidence in a human race dominated by a bourgeoisie given to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better .
He summed it all up himself :
As I drift toward my last sigh , I often imagine a final joke .
I convoke around my deathbed my friends who are confirmed atheists as I am .
Then a priest , whom I have summoned , arrives ;
and to the horror of my friends , I make my confession , ask for absolution for my sins , and receive extreme unction .
After which I turn over on my side and expire .
But will I have the strength to joke at that moment ?
Luis Bunuel died in 1983 .
Note : There 's a piece by George Packer in The New Yorker ( " Betrayed : the Iraqis who trusted America the most " ) about all this , but it 's way too long to blog here .
Check it out if you want .
It 's hair - raising stuff .
Christ , can no one trust an American anymore ?
I 'm gettting sick and tired of being ashamed of the USA .
What have we come to ?
Fuck , piss , shit .
Anyway , here 's a shorter piece from Mother Jones :
Thrown to the Assassins
They cheered the U.S. invasion ;
they offered to help , signed on as translators , risked everything they had to work for the United States .
But when they had to run for their lives , America slammed the door .
By David Case / Mother Jones
On the day the American tanks rolled into Baghdad , Abather Abdul Hussein and his wife , Balqes Abdel Mohammed , threw flowers .
Literally .
After a lifetime of turmoil and tyranny , the couple fervently believed the invasion would bring peace .
Abather joined U.S. " democratization " efforts , such as a project to create a governing council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally ended up in the good - news Iraq stories that still seemed plausible in those days ;
one U.S. paper ran a five - column photo of him perched on a classroom chair surrounded by American soldiers , with a story about the " new Iraq . "
These days , Abather and his young family are among the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have fled in fear for their lives .
After months spent dodging insurgents who had targeted them for supporting the Americans , he and Balqes are relieved to have escaped -- and bitter , like thousands of fellow refugees , that the superpower for which they risked their lives has abandoned them .
A short man who bundles his shattered body in layers against the desert 's winter chill , the 34 - year - old Abather is polite and relaxed , with an easy smile .
An engaging conversationalist even in broken English , he loves to talk about Baghdad , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several years his senior , whom he calls a genius .
" When we met she was a professor at Baghdad University , " he boasts .
" I was her student .
When she walked into a room , hundreds of people would stand to pay her respect . "
Considering that his life savings will run out in two months , that he ca n't work legally in Jordan , and that he could be deported at any moment , Abather is remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leaks out in tics .
He chain - smokes cheap Craven A cigarettes , crushing the charred filters in an overflowing ashtray ;
when Balqes complains , he sheepishly offers that " smoking is my only work . "
It 's not quite true --
his one other job during the past 18 months has been recounting his nightmare , over and over again , to border guards , embassy workers , and aid agencies .
In December , he reluctantly told it to me , pulling documents from a worn leather folder to corroborate the details .
The story began after the ouster of Saddam , when Abather and Balqes , like many Iraqis , launched a de - Baathification program of their own .
Their target was the dean who had been Balqes ' boss at Baghdad University ( and who , as Abather tells it , had forced her out when she resisted joining the Baath Party ) .
Balqes wanted her job back ;
one day Abather confronted the dean ,
and tempers flared .
American soldiers broke up the brawl , bound Abather 's wrists with a zip tie , and interrogated him .
He explained Balqes ' gripe and what the loss of her job had meant for their family , including their 3 - year - old son and Balqes ' 14 - year - old son from a previous marriage ( her first husband had been killed in the Iran - Iraq War ) .
Though he held a master 's degree in engineering , Abather had n't been able to get a job in the doldrums of sanctions - era Iraq ,
so he was scraping together a living repairing watches , his wife and children crammed into his father 's small home .
" The soldiers were very understanding , " Abather recalls .
" I was impressed . "
They offered the family an apartment in a place called Iraqi Village , a compound near the Baghdad airport where Saddam had housed orphans he was grooming to become fedayeen loyalists .
In return , the couple translated for the Americans , and eventually the Washington National Guard 's 1st Battalion 303rd Armored Regiment hired Balqes as an interpreter , at $ 15 per day .
Abather ended up leading a U.S. Army - contracted security squad with a monthly salary of $ 130 .
Learning that he was an engineer , soldiers later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignments .
He started an engineering firm and worked with contractors such as ABB and Kellogg , Brown and Root ;
in one heady year , Abather 's contracts would mushroom from a few thousand dollars to an $ 862,000 electrification project ( later canceled because he could n't procure the needed equipment ) .
Abather and Balqes glow with wonder when they speak of those days , of earning a good living and having their own home for the first time .
Most of all , Abather enjoyed hanging out with the Americans .
He seems to remember every soldier he ever met :
Captain Philips and Sergeant Buchard gave his children toys , a soccer ball , and school stationery ;
Lieutenant Glenn Allen got so close to the family they called him " Uncle Allen . "
( Allen confirmed Abather 's story in emails to me , calling him and Balqes " very helpful individuals " who " risked their lives by meeting with us . " )
It was as if they had suddenly found themselves citizens of the 51st state .
And so , in October 2004 , when Abather got his first death threat , he thought it was a joke .
It was handwritten , tucked under the windshield wiper of his car inside Iraqi Village , a gated community with American checkpoints at both its entrances ;
The note read :
Abather , Leave your work with the Americans .
Otherwise you will be killed by jihadis because you are a traitor .
Jihad Army
Then the killings began .
Lieutenant Allen had once given Abather a photo depicting two American soldiers with five of their Iraqi friends .
Three of the Iraqis were assassinated in short order .
Abather began to notice cars following him ,
and a few times shots were fired at his car .
The anonymous notes grew increasingly menacing .
Eventually , Iraqi Village felt so dangerous that Abather and Balqes moved the family back to his father 's house .
A death threat arrived there almost immediately .
Still Abather continued working with the Americans .
One day in August 2005 , Abather was driving Balqes , six months pregnant with their second child , to a doctor 's appointment .
At an intersection , he noticed a gold car parked by the road ;
suddenly the two men in it leveled guns at him .
" This is the end , " Abather thought ,
and then a U.S. patrol appeared
and the assailants vanished into traffic .
Within days , Abather and Balqes had sold off their belongings and fled to Amman .
Their troubles had only just begun .
The U.S. Embassy in Amman is an attractive , Arabian - style fortress , heavily guarded machine - gunners in Ford pickups .
It sits high on a hillside ,
and the view is so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reaching all the way to the Iraqi border , some 200 miles away .
In the foreground , Amman 's rolling mosaic of pale , boxy limestone buildings shimmers against the azure sky .
At its edges , in dank apartments on outlying hillsides , lives a substantial portion of Baghdad 's educated middle class .
Almost all fled in a panic , after getting death threats or seeing loved ones murdered ;
many were targeted by insurgents or jihadis because they supported , or worked for , the Americans .
Of Iraq 's 27 million prewar population , about 1 in 8 -- some 3.4 million people -- have left their homes since the invasion , according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( unhcr ) ,
and more than half of those have ended up abroad .
Refugees International labels this the world 's fastest - growing humanitarian crisis .
Yet the Bush administration has refused to so much as acknowledge the refugees ' plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
In the past , notes Bill Frelick , refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch , the United States has often aided those persecuted for supporting it ;
since the Vietnam War , 1 million Vietnamese refugees have been resettled in the United States , including tens of thousands of South Vietnamese army veterans .
But the Bush administration " has abdicated that obligation , " says Frelick .
" The people who have fled are the ones the administration was relying on to build democracy in Iraq ;
it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative has failed . "
It was in Jordan that Abather and Balqes discovered the limitations of their friendship with the United States .
Lieutenant " Uncle " Allen had emailed the embassy in Amman to explain that the family feared for their lives ;
he 'd even offered to sponsor their relocation " to the safety of the United States . "
An unsigned email from the embassy commended Allen -- " I know that your Iraqi friends appreciate your friendship " -- but noted that U.S. visas are " quite difficult " for Iraqis to get .
Since 9 / 11 , Middle Easterners in general , and Iraqis in particular , have faced enormous hurdles getting admitted to the United States ;
until 2005 , the Bush administration maintained a total freeze on Iraqis that shut out current refugees as well as hundreds of people who had fled Saddam Hussein 's regime years earlier .
The email nonetheless provided instructions on getting a tourist visa ,
and Abather and Balqes quickly filed their application along with the $ 200 fee -- almost two months ' rent .
Several months later they were notified that they could visit the United States for up to three months , but that they could not bring their children .
They then made repeated visits to the unhcr to apply for official refugee status .
As it has with almost 99 percent of the Iraqis who have come through its office in Amman , the agency turned them down .
Abather and Balqes set their sights on a visa to Australia , a major destination for Iraqi refugees , and even hired an Iraqi lawyer there .
They waited for months .
Their savings dwindled ;
then their baby fell ill ,
and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ 2,100 in cash .
In early June 2006 , Abather got a rejection letter from Australia .
Around the same time , word came that his father had died of a heart attack .
So he went back to Iraq to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidized medicine for his daughter .
But when he returned to the Jordanian border less than a week later , he was told he could n't reenter the country :
Having recently suffered two terrorist attacks , Jordan had enacted a ban on entry for Iraqi men aged 17 to 35 .
For two days Abather stood on the highway at the border post , beseeching successive shifts of immigration officials .
Finally , a guard promised to send the medicine to his family in Amman if he would just go away .
Once again Abather headed back to Baghdad .
Driving in Baghdad a few days later , he noticed a bmw -- the Iraqi gangster 's vehicle of choice -- in his rearview mirror , closing in .
The car forced him off the road ;
armed men blindfolded him and knocked him unconscious .
When he woke up , he was in a tiny room , handcuffed to a chair .
Masked men came and went , videotaping as they cursed him as a traitor .
They whipped him with a steel cable ;
six months later , his back was still etched by deep , evenly spaced grooves .
" We 've been searching for you for a year , " his captors told him .
Abather recognized the voice of one man , an acquaintance from Iraqi Village who had seemed to befriend the Americans .
" I 'm sorry your father passed away , " the man said .
Soon , a bearded imam sentenced Abather to decapitation for collaborating with the United States .
Abather barely heard the proceedings .
" I was thinking the whole time about my little daughter in Amman . "
He was told he could save himself by spying on the Americans , but he refused .
On the eighth day , the men asked if there was anything he wanted before he died ;
then they put him on the floor in the back of the bmw and sped off .
Suddenly , Abather heard gunshots .
The men shouted .
The car crashed ,
and everything went black .
He woke up in a hospital bed 60 miles from Baghdad ;
Iraqi forces had attacked the bmw and pulled him from the burning wreck .
He had a compound fracture in his leg and severe burns all over his body ,
but the nurses urged him to leave :
His captors would be looking for him .
His brother -- who had received a ransom note from the kidnappers , complete with a photo of Abather bound and gagged -- brought him back to Baghdad , where doctors fused a piece of plastic onto his shin and grafted skin from his thighs over his wounds .
A few weeks later , he was back at the Jordanian border ,
and this time the guards took pity .
The family had n't told Balqes of the kidnapping .
But when she saw her disfigured husband , she says , " I knew right away what happened . "
On a crisp , clear day this past December , clutching a sheaf of papers documenting Abather and Balqes ' ordeal -- contracts , soldiers ' recommendations , death threats , a missing - person report -- I headed to American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy in Amman .
Abather and Balqes had made several pilgrimages there ;
they were convinced that if only they could speak to an American , Abather 's charred and mangled flesh would make their case , but they had never gotten past the Jordanian security guards .
Outside the embassy , I joined a chatty , eclectic crowd of Americans : a retired hippie turned English teacher from Vermont ; a woman with a New York accent who struggled through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a Santa hat , who said he was picking up his passport before returning to the North Pole .
I wondered whether any of us would risk our lives for the United States as Abather and Balqes had .
To get past the compound 's first wall , we navigated a metal detector , a body frisk , and an X - ray machine ;
after crossing a 30 - foot no man 's land we repeated the process at the second wall .
Then we waited to be called .
The United States admits more refugees than any country in the world ,
but in 2006 , only 202 Iraqis were allowed in ,
and most of them had fled persecution under Saddam before the war .
This year , millions of Iraqis , Tibetans , Sri Lankans , and Afghans must compete for a mere 5,500 refugee slots Congress has allocated for the Middle East and South Asia .
The Iraqis are in line behind their compatriots who have been waiting in Jordan since the late 1990s .
Like other Western representatives , U.S. officials here refer displaced people to the unhcr , which is charged with determining whether someone is a real refugee , and if so , with finding him a safe place to go .
Except that , as Amman unhcr head Robert Breen told me , a 1998 agreement with Jordan forbids the agency from classifying anyone as a refugee whom it ca n't get out of the country within six months -- an impossibility in the post / 11 world .
( A country of about 6 million , Jordan has long had the world 's highest refugee population per capita , hosting more than a million Palestinians who fled Israel in 1948 and were supposed to stay only a short time . )
Of the 21,000 Iraqi asylum seekers the office has registered since the U.S. invasion , only 291 have been granted refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the unhcr 's gates gets longer every week ,
and the wait for an interview stands at five months .
To care for all of the region 's displaced Iraqis , the agency had a total budget of $ 22 million in 2006 -- less than $ 7 a person , which must cover not only the Kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugees trapped in desert camps or squatting in abandoned buildings .
Recognizing the potential for " severe humanitarian suffering , " the Iraq Study Group in December recommended that " the United States take the lead " in funding the UNHCR 's Iraq program ;
currently it donates no more than a quarter of the budget .
Direct U.S. aid to the refugees consists of a tiny grant to the Catholic relief organization Caritas ( see " How to Help , " page 68 ) .
At the embassy , I recounted Abather and Balqes ' ordeal at Window 3 , then at Window 1 -- the setup was similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
Then , at Window 4 , I told the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wearing a telephone headset .
I was expecting to hear that " the United States is doing its best to help , "
but there was only silence as the consul 's eyes welled up .
( An Amman - based aid worker later told me that American diplomats are so distraught by the policies they are charged with representing that " it just takes a few gin and tonics and they 'll break down . " )
Finally , the consul said , " We hear stories like this all the time .
We have enormous empathy for the Iraqis who 've suffered after working with the Americans ,
but there 's really nothing the embassy can do for them . "
She handed me a document outlining Congress ' sole concession to people like Abather and Balqes : visas for up to 50 military translators from Iraq or Afghanistan each year .
" But do n't get their hopes up , " she added quickly ;
there were thousands with the same story .
" This is something Congress really needs to address , " she said as we parted .
The administration certainly does n't seem inclined to take the initiative .
Philip A. Frayne , an embassy spokesman in Amman , told me that " there are no reliable figures " on how many people have fled Iraq , and that in any case , it was Saddam who drove out " a large percentage " of them .
Likewise , in its 2006 annual refugee report to Congress , the State Department focused mainly on those Saddam - era exiles , and blithely intoned , " It is hoped that significant numbers of Iraqi refugees will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . "
The report ignored the fact that , according to a survey by the nonprofit U.S. Committee for Refugees , 644,500 new refugees entered Jordan and Syria in 2005 alone .
And 2006 will likely be worse .
As much as a quarter of greater Amman 's population is now Iraqi ,
and the crowds have exacerbated the city 's severe water shortage .
Prices have skyrocketed .
Until recently Iraqi children could n't attend Jordanian schools ,
and their parents can not legally work ;
easily identified by their dialect , Iraqis are discriminated against and terrified of deportation .
Some refugees never go outside .
Jordanian government spokesman Nasser S. Judeh told me that his country , a staunch U.S. ally and aid recipient , " certainly needs help , and has held discussions with U.S. diplomats " about this issue .
Incidentally , Human Rights Watch has also called upon the Gulf Arab states to pitch in ;
Saudi Arabia 's response so far has been to plan construction of a 560 - mile wall along its border with Iraq .
Before I left Jordan , Abather invited me to visit his family and a physician friend from Baghdad who shares their two - room basement apartment .
On the Al Zawraa TV channel from Baghdad , we watched U.S. Army vehicles disappear behind roadside bomb blasts as a man sang , " Let 's go kill the Americans ! "
The channel 's endless stream of anti - American propaganda perplexed Abather and his friends :
" Why does the United States allow this ? " they inquired .
When images of dead children supposedly killed by the Americans hit the screen , Abather 's friend switched to a channel on which voluptuous Arab women danced in an un - Islamic way .
Balqes served Iraqi coffee ,
and to keep the baby from playing with the colorful cups , Abather suspended her from an elastic swing above our heads .
She giggled as he bounced her by her tiny foot .
This is her prison , he joked .
Six months after the kidnapping , he still had n't gotten the surgery he needed to heal his burned flesh ;
if the wounds become infected , he could die .
Abather rarely complained .
God is testing us , he said .
But we will get through it .
He looked at the girl bouncing from the ceiling and smiled .
I have a daughter ,
and I 'm very happy .
Balqes was more fearful -- twice in the past month , suspicious men had shown up at the apartment .
Iraq , she worried , had already caught up with them .
How to Help
Very few organizations are working on getting aid to Iraqi refugees , and of those that are , many are too small or too beleaguered to accept individual donations ;
the Iraqi Red Crescent , for example , has suffered bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteers continue to deliver aid to displaced families inside Iraq .
One of the larger relief organizations working with the refugees is the Catholic group Caritas , whose caseworkers I shadowed while in Amman .
Bucking the image of the Land Rover - driving aid worker , they made their rounds in an aging gray Honda , its roof eaten through by rust .
They visited Iraqi doctors , engineers , and executives desperate for food , heat , or blankets to fend off the desert winter ;
one family told the crew they had just sold their stove to buy food .
Caritas helps a few thousand families a year ,
but the demand far outstrips the money available to us , says Magy Mahrous , who oversees the project .

At first , I signed up for a blog on DONEWS , thinking that it was a site for IT professionals where I could perhaps find friends more easily .
Later , I signed up for another one on MSN , feeling that writing on MSN might make it easier for me to communicate directly with my MSN pals .
But gradually , I discovered that both sites were not very good .
At that time , DONEWS did not have the function of tallying traffic statistics ( I have the habit of looking at the statistics of everything ) ; and even though MSN had that function , others needed to sign on to MSN before they could reply , this meant that after reading the entries , many could not reply even if they wanted to , hence largely reducing the interactive element .
The enthusiasm with writing the blog at the beginning was short - lived ; after writing a few original articles for promotion , I did not continue anymore .
At that time , I did n't think about posting articles from other sites as I felt that there was no need to post any articles if I could not come up with anything original ; this meant that sometimes for over two months I did n't even update a new entry .
Later , there were also some minor problems with both MSN and DONEWS , so I became more unwilling to post new articles .
So , these two blogs have not really been very popular , either
One of the hypotheses states : a long time ago , in order to hide from wild beasts roaming on the land , humans had ever lived in shallow water regions for a long period of time , surviving on aquatic plants and fishes .
Therefore , the body hairs , which increased the friction in water , had fallen off .
The reason for this explanation is that the fine hairs on the back of humans run from one side of the shoulder toward the spine , a different direction from that of monkeys .
Only such a direction could reduce the friction in water , and provide more buoyancy for the person who is swimming in the water .
However , in all the primitive gathering settlements that have been discovered so far , we have not seen any settlement where people lived in such a way .
What is worse is -- from the perspective of the direction of the fine hairs as well -- the fine hairs on humans ' upper arm point downward , while the fine hairs on the lower arm point upward , which is to say , they all run toward the elbow .
This is somewhat similar to monkeys who have hairs : when it rains , they would hold their heads with their hands , and such a direction of their hairs would be easier for the rain to flow away along their elbows
What was Saddam prosecuted for ?
Earlier on , Iran 's involvement with the Euro - for - oil transactions turned out to be a big news item with negligible after - effects , and finally it became a non - issue , and hence there was no problem for Iran and the United States .
But this time , Putin came up with a Ruble - for - oil proposal , and even began intensive preparations .
Nobody would have any doubts about the technical capacity of Russia , not to mention its ability to protect its own resources and trade systems ,
The intimidation that Russia had inflicted on Ukraine is still remembered with a tinge of fear by some European brother - like countries .
The Ruble is allowed to float freely now , but everyone still has sufficient reasons to doubt the replacement of the US dollar in Dollar - for - oil .
But what was more vicious about Comrade Putin was that he had rolled out what is known as a " barbarous " gold system ; and that is , before the wide acceptance of the Ruble - for - oil , a portion of Russia 's annual oil revenues would be channeled toward increasing the country 's holdings of gold .
This is the first among all major countries to have issued such a clear proclamation - no wonder the recent link between gold and oil had almost been severed .
Following the government 's announcement of new immigration regulations , all travelers arriving in New Zealand will receive the same treatment as they would receive when going to the US .
When they enter the country , they will be asked to provide biometric information .
At a press conference this afternoon , new immigration law confirmed by Immigration Minister David Cunliffe will give immigration officials the power to collect , store and use biometric information of non - New Zealand citizens .
These so - called non - New Zealand citizens include people with a tourist , temporary or residency visa .
These new regulations are very similar to procedures for entering the US .
The new immigration law also permits the immigration service to provide " limited " biometric information on New Zealand citizens to neighboring countries .
However , the law does not explain the reason .
Cunliffe said , it has presently not been decided when or how the biometric information will be collected from people 's bodies .
The government has introduced legislation that will permit further collection of DNA samples from people 's bodies .
The new regulation on biometric information is only one article among the sixty - one articles that make up the new regulations .
Cunliffe said the new regulations will effectively simplify border - entry procedures and protect citizens ' right and international human rights .
In New Westminster , a homicide occurred yesterday in an apartment where many Chinese reside ,
A youth in his 20s was suspected to have been seriously attacked after he left a party ; he was found lying in one of the apartment units , and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital .
After the event , two men were detained by the police to assist in the investigations , the motive of the murder remains unclear , and the case is now referred to the Provincial Integrated Homicide Investigation Team for further investigations .
According to the spokesman for the Provincial Integrated Homicide Investigation Team , Dale Carr , the crime scene was in an apartment unit on the 800 block of Agnes Street ( Agnes St. ) in New Westminster .
The police received an emergency 911 call at 12:20 a.m. yesterday , and rushed to the address mentioned above to investigate .
When the police arrived at the scene , they found an injured man lying in the unit ; he was seriously wounded , and certified dead upon arrival at the hospital .
The body was sent to the coroner for an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death .
For now , the police will not announce the name of the victim ; it will be decided upon only after the family is notified .
As to the cause of the victim 's death , and whether the case is linked to any illegal activities and others and etc. , the police declined comment .
Carr also said that the police had applied for a search warrant from the court yesterday morning , and entered the unit in the afternoon with the warrant for a detailed investigation , in order to understand more about the incident .
Investigators from the Identification Bureau also went to collect information from the scene later ,
As to the motive of the attack , and whether the police had found the weapon , the police have declined disclosure .
In the face of criticism and nitpicking , I believe that Jesus is weaker than Darwin .
Why ?
Because Darwin was allowed to make mistakes , since he was a human being ; but Jesus was not allowed to make mistakes , since he had been described as God .
Darwin proposed Evolution Theory , but it was just a theory , and he himself also admitted that there were many questions ,
Others may agree with him , or they may accept some parts while disagreeing with other parts , or in the future we might discover that the general direction of Darwin 's evolution is largely correct though filled with a lot of errors , and that there might be an improved version of evolution which is more accurate and comprehensive than what Darwin had proposed .
But as the originator , Darwin deserves much credit .
Jesus is God , and the Bible is the word of God .
God creates everything , understands everything , predicts the future , and is infinitely resourceful , so how can he be wrong !
Therefore , if you find a sentence that is allegedly said by God , but effectively turns out to be wrong , then this god will be overthrown .
Therefore , Jesus is more vulnerable to criticism than Darwin , because once an error is found , then he could not be the true god .
After the collapse of Saddam Hussein 's dictatorial regime , Iraqi religious forces had entered a period of revitalization and expansion ,
Although the distribution system of the new legislative power in Iraq had generally taken care of the interests of all parties , and found a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic groups and sects -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim government would not have been successfully generated -- this does not mean that there were no contradictions among them .
From an internal point of view , Shiites and Kurds tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefits , and Iraqi politics had almost become the arena of these two factions ,
Although under the balance of interests some of Sunni political figures were involved in politics , what the Sunni radical groups were most concerned about was that the Shiites would turn around and suppress them in the future .
In February of this year , a radical Sunni organization attacked the Ali Mosque , which is the religious shrine of Shiite Muslims , and this led to the eruption of the conflict between Iraq 's two largest parties .
The assassination of the Lebanese Minister of Industry has triggered off angry protests from supporters , plunging Lebanon into yet another precarious situation .
In merely two short years , this minister is the fifth senior official to be assassinated ; this shows that even after the forced withdrawal of Israeli troops , long - suffering Lebanon still has n't ushered in the peace that it hoped for yet .
The United States claimed that the Syrian government was the murderer , but Syria retorted by saying that the accusation was " totally without foundation , and in disregard of facts . "
At this moment , the real murderer is probably tittering , but the world has clearly seen that any one of the regimes of Lebanese and Iraqi is more fragile than the other .
The Western media said that in the " post - Bush " garbage era , countries like Iraq , Syria , and Lebanon will encounter a lot more good shows or terrible tragedies .
And the people believed that .
It is uncertain whether the Canadian Prime Minister had taken the political equivalent of Viagra , or had lost his mind due to political biases , but he " lost his temper " several times in China during APEC , and almost messed up his meeting with President Hu .
Fortunately President Hu was magnanimous enough not to take it to heart , and gave him the honor of a 15 - minute meeting .
However , when this fellow returned to his own country , he boasted recklessly by saying that his meeting with President Hu had " important historical significance , " and even exaggerated by claiming it as his " major diplomatic achievement . "
But those Canadian opponents already disgruntled with him , seeing through his tricks , could immediately tell that the meetings that President Hu had such as with Bush , Abe , and Putin all lasted over an hour ; a mere 15 - minute meeting with you -- excluding the pleasantries and translations -- was no different from an extended hand - shake .
This early morning the soccer match between the Chinese women 's team and the Korean team had indeed made me excited , I was surprised by the match 's brilliance , and I also gained a new understanding of the Korean team .
They attacked swiftly and fearlessly and coordinated with tacit understanding , but looking back at the Chinese women 's soccer team , it was in an inferior position either in time - control or coordination .
We lost this game with no complaints .
But looking at the match between the Chinese men 's soccer team and the Iranians , that goal -- the insulting , provocative , and perverse goal -- made me question the quality of the Iranian team and even of the people in that country .
The Chinese team showed their guts during this game ; they manifested the courage and fighting spirit of Chinese people .
We did not shy away from the powerful Iranian team , but did our best ; it was n't until after an overtime and two rounds of penalty kicks that we then regretfully lost the match .
Let us remember the Iranian team , remember this Iranian player who scored this goal -- Borhani .
The IOC warriors return to our motherland with hope .
I believe there will eventually be a day when we will -- avenge
[ ] A high school teacher teaching chemistry in the United Kingdom has appealed to the Department of Education to allow the views and theories that God created everything and intellectual life created the world to be introduced into school to be taught to students together along with Darwin 's theory of evolution , which has been dominating the scientific community since the 19th century , and let students judge between right and wrong for themselves .
[ ] The long - standing policy of British Department of Education has been that the theories such as God 's creation are " unsuitable " for primary and secondary education .
[ ] Critics have pointed out that some scholars from non - English countries actually have long mistranslated evolution theory and misinterpreted Darwin 's original intent , and the translation itself has a natural development from low to high level , a falsehood with almost religious bearings .
[ ] Also some Western scholars - such as paleontologists and archaeologists from the United Kingdom , France , and Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries - have long made use of the distorted theory of evolution and social Darwinism derived from the argument to attempt to prove their point that certain races are more advanced than others .
In the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media .
With their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .
The world 's fifth Disney park will soon open to the public here .
The most important thing about Disney is that it is a global brand .
Well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect .
Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland .
The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .
In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
One .
Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong .
As its neighbor on Lantau Island , Hong Kong International Airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
Mickey Mouse 's new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .
There 's only one month left before the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12 .
The subway to Disney has already been constructed .
At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .
Meanwhile , the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .
For two years , Disney has constantly maintained its mystery .
No media have been allowed to enter for photos .
We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward Disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .
However , before any of the Disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards Disney .
On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
Er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially opened , opened , all , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
No one can enter otherwise .
Video recording is especially forbidden .
Ah , everything is top secret .
If pictures are taken without permission , % pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .
Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .
Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit Hong Kong .
From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists have , have come to Hong Kong .
Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .
At this point , it has been about two years .
Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .
Hong Kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today 's international metropolis .
Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
When in Hong Kong , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok .
You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .
You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in Hong Kong .
You can ascend Victoria Peak to get a panoramic view of Victoria Harbor 's beautiful scenery .
Or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
After dark , cruise Victoria Harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
Every corner of Hong Kong is filled with fun .
Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us ?
Over the past 28 years , the Ocean Park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong .
Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea .
These items , which were the pride of the Ocean Park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong for some time .
However , since Disney entered Hong Kong , the Ocean Park , sharing the same city as Disney , has felt the pressure of competition .
To improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .
It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
That is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .
Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .
It seems that those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will also be renovated after several years .
Are they going to be different from what they are now ?
They will be , in ten years .
Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
It looks like we will also bring in whales .
Er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .
Groundbreaking is expected to start next year .
Yes .
The area of Hong Kong is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .
The population is dense .
Natural resources are relatively scarce .
However , the clever Hong Kong people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the Hong Kong tourism industry .
Among these is the Avenue of Stars .
Entering Hollywood of the East ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
He is my .
She is my Goddess , ah .
Please stay with us on New World Travel .
Hong Kong has always worn the crown of Hollywood of the East .
Over the past 100 years of film history , Hong Kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
They have shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the world .
Hong Kong movies have even become a window for the world to see Hong Kong , which have made the image of metropolitan Hong Kong more prominent internationally .
For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed the Avenue of Stars , memorializing Hong Kong 's 100 - year film history .
Here , tourists can learn about Hong Kong 's film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .
Hong Kong is a busy metropolis .
Even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
Across from the Avenue of Stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .
% pw As our Victoria Harbor is % pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
So , one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage .
Er , each key building is like a performer .
It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi - media world - class light show .
Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza , Bank of China Tower , at 8:00 every Saturday night , HSBC Main Building .
Their performances will be on schedule .
Center of the East Central .
Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island reveal themselves one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
Some , er , cities have consulted with us .
Uh - huh .
Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
Yes .
The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of Hong Kong hopes to be involved , so that the Hong Kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the Hong Kong SAR government for advancing the Hong Kong tourism industry .
This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the Hong Kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
Hong Kong Wetland Park covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor 's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
In the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
Outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
At the highest point of Hong Kong , er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .
Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but behind me is our Wetland Park .
Ha , entirely different .
Quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .
Lastly , farthest away you can see Putian of Shenzhen .
Then , the bridge is , on the bridge is Hong Kong and outside is Shenzhen .
You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .
Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
Ah , the most special is rice , because % pw many Hong Kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .
Look over there .
They are going to be ripe soon .
The long one over there .
Oh .
Yes .
With , with ears , ah .
Where ?
Ah , here .
Perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
Let , let them get some understanding .
Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .
Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .
As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
These have become the best spots to observe birds .
Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
Uh - huh .
Ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .
Wow .
Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter .
Some of them , er , have stayed in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
Uh - huh .
So , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
Uh - huh .
Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .
They will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .
Ah , we have established the year 2006 as Discover Hong Kong Year .
Why is that ?
Because , as everyone knows , our Disneyland will open in September of this year .
In addition , we will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha .
They add to what we already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .
Moreover , er , we are including our software .
Hong Kong 's software is very well known .
Like what 's used in our Symphony of Lights .
We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year .
Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
Because your line connects us with two --
In recent years , Hong Kong 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory .
Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Lantau Island of the New Territory .
For this reason , Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot .
The earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .
In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .
Therefore , Hong Kong 's Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the east , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China .
As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .
The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent .
No , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross - sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao .
In 1992 --
Could n't go in summer --
So , after their return , Macao , and Hong Kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .
It 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
One has to go up to Shenzhen , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to Zhuhai , then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao .
For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross - sea bridge proposal .
With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .
However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
This is what we have seen since 1999 .
Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .
Well , originally the construction of the new --
With this new Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , Hong Kong , Macao , and Zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
Macao is this way , and Zhuhai is this way .
From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .
Er , % pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours , Macao for entertainment , and we have Disneyland and other , other attractions in Hong Kong .
Each place has different attractions of its own .
So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later .
Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .
However , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
Ah , currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .
There 's also what we call soft opening .
Ah , they are now rehearsing .
Ah , different , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in September .
Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
The Wonder Tour will start from Hong Kong .

On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of ASEAN , the heads of the nine ASEAN countries and the heads of China , Japan and South Korea held an informal meeting in Kuala Lumpur , capital of Malaysia , on the 15th .
The next day , the heads of China , Japan and South Korea held informal meetings again with the heads of the ASEAN countries separately .
This informal meeting of heads of Eastern Asian countries , the first time in history , is a good start .
After the end of the cold war , ASEAN confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast Asia region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .
ASEAN , with China , Japan and South Korea , strengthened their cooperation and jointly planned development , becoming a force that holds the balance .
Therefore , the holding of the informal meeting of heads of the countries in eastern Asia possesses important significance in promoting cooperation between all countries , in safeguarding regional and global security , and in accelerating the development towards world multi - polarization .
The development of countries can not be separated from the region , and that of the region can not be separated from the globe .
Discarding old concepts and establishing new international political and economic orders conforms with the main trend of the times in which people of all countries demand peace , request development , seek stability and promote cooperation .
To correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east Asian economic cooperation in the 21st century and forecasting the future development of eastern Asia are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern Asia .
Peace is a precondition to economic development .
Without a peaceful environment , any construction undertaking would be impossible to discuss .
Only when long - term peace is realized can the realization of sustained development be possible .
Therefore it is necessary to breed a new kind of security concept and to seek new methods to safeguard peace .
To establish relations between countries on the basis of the five principles , namely mutual respect of sovereignty and integrity of territory , non - aggression , non - interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , is the political basis and precondition for global and regional security .
That all countries strengthen their mutual benefits and cooperation in the field of economy , open up to each other , eliminate inequalities and discriminatory policies in economic and trade transactions , gradually narrow the development gaps between countries and strive for joint prosperity is the economic basis for global and regional security .
That all countries promote mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and cooperation , and promise to settle disputes and conflicts between countries in peaceful ways is a realistic way to ensure peace and security .
This year some countries in eastern Asia encountered financial turmoil and have had some difficulties in their economic development , but the economic basis of east Asian countries is still good and advantageous factors for economic development still exist .
In the course of this meeting , leaders of east Asian countries unanimously supported the suggestion to expand local trade and investment .
It is believed that after reviewing experience and implementing proper adjustments , the economy of eastern Asia will definitely continue to move forward in development .
The east Asian countries are not entirely without conflicts and disputes .
But in order to safeguard fundamental benefits to the people of all east Asian countries , and to promote the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind , we must progressively strengthen the east Asian cooperation .
Chairman Zemin Jiang solemnly elaborated on China 's stand at this meeting .
He emphatically pointed out that " We should uphold the principles of mutual respect , equal participation , mutual benefit , and co - development ; we should strengthen cooperation in economy and technology , especially in the field of new high level technology , and establish reasonable regional economic structures , and form a mode of economic cooperation on the basis of learning from others ' strengths and offsetting others ' weaknesses , and mutual benefiting from advantages , balancing interests , and practicing non - exclusiveness and non - discrimination ; and we should strengthen trust , broaden common understanding , seek common points while maintaining differences , and resolve disputes appropriately through friendly dialogue and consultation to guarantee the region 's peace and stability . "
Everything is difficult at the very beginning .
With this good start , people have good reason to believe that the coordination and cooperation between east Asian countries will certainly show more hopeful prospects in the near future .

Qichen Qian also made a comment on the fact that beginning this year , the Taiwan authorities continued to practice the so - called " practical diplomacy " , advocated that Taiwan was a so - called " independent sovereign state " , and actively set up obstacles in the negotiations between both sides of the straits .
He said that accomplishing the complete unification of the motherland was the common wish of all the Chinese people throughout the country and abroad .
Since Hong Kong 's return to the motherland , relations between both sides of the straits has drawn greater attention .

We hope Taiwanese authorities conform to the historical development trends , and take opportunities to make active responses and wise choices for political negotiations between both sides of the Straits .

After the successful implementation of a " soft landing " , the rumbling train of China 's economy is running forward smoothly at high speed .
" Proper , quick and stable " growth will become the main theme of this year 's economic development .
Official authorities revealed that this year the Chinese government determined that the economic growth rate was 8 % and price levels will be controlled within 3 % .
This means that the whole economic operation situation will maintain a healthy pattern of " high growth and low inflation " .
People in economic circles seem to be more optimistic about the economic outlook .
The growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the State Planning Commission , the Statistical Bureau and the China Academy of Social Sciences , is mostly 1 to 2 percentage points higher than governmental plans .
Of course , to a relatively large extent , this depends on aggregate control of using monetary policy as a primary means , or in other words , under the major premises of general tightening , how financial control should timely and reasonably conduct fine tuning .
Moreover , the impact of Southeast Asia 's financial crisis should not be underestimated .
On the part of the government , the keynote of a moderately tight macro - economic policy will not be changed .
The key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the second half year of 1993 obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .
Actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro - economic situation tends to loosen , China 's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .
This year , China plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .
Fixed assets investments will grow by 10 % this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by 10 % and export growth by 8 % .
At the same time , the financial deficit will be reduced by 10 billion yuan .
After bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity 's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .
Hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .
Along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized State owned enterprises , the pace of State owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by 20 % and a number of competitive large and medium - sized State owned enterprises will gradually form .
However , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .
China has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within 3.5 % through implementation of a large scale " re - employment " project .
According to estimates , after three years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year 's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .
Agriculture 's increasing production and peasants ' increasing revenues will create favorable conditions for inhibiting commodity prices and realizing the target of steady economic development .
Currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of China 's economy has reached 42 % , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .
Under the circumstances of a relative steady domestic demand , the pulling effect of the trend of foreign trade towards economic development is more striking .
Taking all factors as a whole , this year 's amount of foreign trade will be increased steadily , the import will be increased and the increasing speed of the export will be somewhat slowed down .
People in economic circles said that China should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .
Forecasting the Year of the Tiger , although China 's economic train will have ups and downs , as long as adjusted and controlled measures are at the right time and appropriate , it is believed that the train will move steadily along the preset track .

Information from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic said that , after high - speed development in previous years , China 's foreign investment attracting has entered an adjustment period .

Since reform and opening up to the outside world , China has been promoting attracting foreign investment even more as an important part of the basic national policy of opening up , the past five years have been five years when foreign merchants ' investments grew fastest , and foreign investments have stepped into the majority of fields of China 's national economy .
The amount of foreign investment actually utilized by China has been increasing in successive years , creating an historical high in 1997 , and a number of projects with particularly intensified technologies and funds have appeared .
On the other hand , since 1994 and 1995 , the number of recently approved foreign investment projects and the contract sum has been continually decreasing , which will directly affect China 's foreign investment attraction growth rate in the period to come .
Experts concerned pointed out that , after high - speed development in previous years , decelerating of the rate of China attracting foreign investment was normal .
However , at the beginning of this year , concerned parties announced that , for projects that had foreign invested , and which were in fields encouraged by China such as the new , high technology industry , infrastructure , etc. , the country would implement certain preferential taxation policies .
According to estimates , these policies would attract more foreign companies to invest in China .

Kazuo Nakamura , Director of Research at Japan 's Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank , said here today that the real growth rate of the world economy in 1998 will be about 3 % .
Kazuo Nakamura , at a public lecture jointly organized by Beijing 's Wu Jia Economic Consulting Company , Ltd. and Japan 's Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank , made a report concerning the new year 's world economic and financial situation .
After he reviewed the world economic and financial situation of '97 , he said that due to the economic growth in Asia , including Japan , further slowing down , the economic growth of America , even though its current economic activity is relatively good , and of other countries will also feel a very large effect .
Compared with the rapid growth of the past , the world economy has entered a period of adjustment .
He forecast that the real growth rate for the world economy this year would fall from the 3.9 % of '97 down to 3 % .
Nakamura thought that the rate of economic growth of Asia 's countries and regions , with Korea and Thailand being the most prominent , would slide downward to a large extent .
But , he said , for these countries the currencies already have devalued to a great degree , exports have recovered , and imports could decrease .
Because of this , he expected that their economies would slip downward to the lowest point in the next half year .
He estimated that the rate of economic growth in ASEAN would be about 4.5 percent .
Nakamura said that the Japanese economy exhibited negative growth in the year '97 , and that in '98 , if it did n't adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .
He estimated it would be negative 0.5 percent , plus or minus .
He said further that China 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of Japan and Asia being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .
But because China 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over 100 billion US dollars in foreign exchange reserves , it is n't likely to sink into the crisis like the other Asian nations .

According to what has been reported in the Soviet " Science and Life " magazine , biologists in Moscow have discovered that a mold element in the cells of plants can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
This method will not pollute the environment .
Biologists mixed a mold element in the cells of plants with pearl powder to produce a granulated drug .
This kind of drug can slowly discharge the mold element from the cells of plants in water .
When mosquitoes feed , they suck the mold element from the cells of plants into their bodies .
Experiments have shown that adopting this method can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to 1/70th to 1/80th of the original ratio .

Today , the " Jerusalem Post " quoted the words of Shawel , director of the Administrative Office of the Israeli Foreign Ministry who is now visiting the US as saying that the World Bank has decided to provide 250 million US dollars of aid to Palestinian Autonomous Authorities before the end of 1994 .
This decision broke the impasse between donor countries and Palestinian Autonomous Authorities that had lasted for nearly one year .
At the international meeting on aiding Palestinian autonomy which was held in Washington on October 1st of last year , donor countries pledged to provide 2.4 billion US dollars of development aid within 5 years , of which 750 million US dollars would be appropriated in the first year .
But donor countries claimed that the Palestinian autonomous region lacks necessary mechanisms for handling the aid and accounting items and therefore refused to completely fulfill this promise .
Shawel said that although the US and the World Bank are currently not completely satisfied with Palestinian accounting work , they have still agreed to pay a portion of the funds as soon as possible .
Arafat , chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization , and other Palestinian leaders have been criticizing the donor countries for not being able to keep their promise to make sure the money aid is completely in place and on time .
It is predicted that Shashe , the PLO 's chief negotiations representative , and Rosechird , Israel 's chief negotiations representative , will go to Washington to specifically negotiate and determine the aid issues with the US and the World Bank .

Premier Peng Li delivered a written speech to welcome the International Population and Development Congress .
He thinks that the Chinese government 's guidelines of planning , strategizing and implementation of the population problem and socioeconomic problems as one is correct , effective in its implementation , and successful .
Peng Li said that in the beginning of September of this year , the United Nations would hold the International Population and Development Congress in Cairo with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .
This shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .
He feels that this Congress has important meaning , and the Chinese government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the Congress .
Peng Li said China was the most populous developing country in the world .
The Chinese government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .
In light of China 's basic national condition , the Chinese government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as two basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits China 's actual needs .
At the same time , the Chinese government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .
Presently , the Chinese economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .
Peng Li said the population problem was one of the major problems currently faced by the international community .
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .
This is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .
He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .
Because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , China will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .
The Chinese government strongly believes that , the resolution of China 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the Chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .
For this , the Chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co - operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !
